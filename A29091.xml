            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Preface to the READER, Concerning <hi>TRITHEISM Charg'd,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HAſty Births commonly are imperfect: If ſo, I have reaſon to fear the Imperfections of the following Papers, which come out without the <hi>Second</hi> and moſt Eſſential <hi>Part,</hi> concerning the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of God.</p>
            <p>My diſtance from the Preſs denies me the Priviledge of Correcting one ſingle Sheet with my own Eyes, or indeed of comparing them ſince their Printing, with my own Copy.</p>
            <p>Since the Printing of more than half the following Papers, a Second Part of the Animadverſions came to my hands, under this Title, <hi>viz. Tritheiſm charged upon Dr.</hi> Sherlock<hi>'s New Notion of the Trinity, &amp;c.</hi> By the Contents I preſently ſaw that the Animadverter had reſumed the Debate: I firſt conſulted thoſe Places which I judged moſt nearly to concern me, and ſince read over the whole: I was ſorrowful that the Preſs was ſo far gone, and in ſo much haſte to finiſh by the end of this Term, that I could not add an Appendix to thoſe few things which the Animadverter has added: However I was on the other hand pleaſed, that as yet I found no reaſon to recant one ſentence of what I had advanced in my Anſwer to the Animadverſions.</p>
            <p>The Debate betwixt the Reverend Dean and the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter, as the Animadverter often ſtates it, is concerning the Truth of theſe Three Articles:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> Whether Self-Conſciouſneſs be the formal reaſon of Perſonality in Finite and Infinite Perſons?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:66343:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Whether Mutual-Conſciouſneſs be the formal reaſon of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Nature in the Divine Perſons?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Whether the Three Divine Perſons may in an Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Senſe be ſtiled Three Infinite Minds?</p>
            <p>The Animadverter reſolves theſe Three Enquiries in the Negative, and charges the Affirmative upon the Reverend Dean.</p>
            <p>I agree with the Animadverter, that the two former ought to be reſolved Negatively.</p>
            <p>I further declare my opinion, That the Reverend Dean never intended the Affirmative Solution of thoſe Queſtions, in a ſtrict and rigorous ſenſe of the Terms; ſo that I am not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly concerned in that part of the Diſpute: Though in my Paſſage I could not forbear noting, <hi>1ſt.</hi> That this Aſſertion of the Animadverter's,<note place="margin">See chap. 3. n. 2.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Self-Conſciouſneſs is a Perſonal Act,</hi> does in its juſt conſequence infer, That the Divine Perſons are Three Abſolute Perſons, Three Abſolute Beings; nay, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Principles, that they have Three Abſolute Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencies or Divine Natures, and conſequently are <hi>Three Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Spirits,</hi> in an higher ſenſe than ever the Reverend Dean intended; and this Conſequence I ſtill challenge him to clear that Aſſertion from, if he can.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">See chap. 3. n. 3, 4.</note>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the ſame Argument which himſelf calls a Demonſtration againſt what he ſuppoſed the Reverend Dean's Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That Self-Conſciouſneſs could not be the formal reaſon of Perſonality, becauſe it was a Perſonal Act, was equally ſtrong againſt his own Hypotheſis, <hi>viz.</hi> That Generation was the formal reaſon of Perſonality in the Perſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and this ſtill ſtands unanſwered, and upon the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter's Principles is, I am ſatisfied, unanſwerable.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">See chap. 2. n. 4, &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I diſcuſs at large that Philoſophical Queſtion, Whether the Soul is a Perſon? which I affirm, and leave him at his leiſure to overthrow if he can. As for that weak Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,<note place="margin">Tritheiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 150.</note> That then the Soul may be ſaid to be <hi>Incarnate,</hi> let me tell him, that this is an Heretical, <hi>Arian</hi> Senſe of this Term
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:66343:3"/>
               <hi>Incarnate,</hi> as if the <hi>WORD</hi> aſſumed only a Body, and not a Human Soul; this Term <hi>Incarnate</hi> ſignifies both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. chap. 2. n. 4, &amp;c.</note> I vindicate the Sacred Article of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the <hi>Socinian</hi> Objections of the Animadverter, which, <hi>in terminis,</hi> he brings againſt the Perſonality of the Soul only, but in reality overthrow the Perſonality of the <hi>WORD,</hi> had they been of any force.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I explain that Subtilty of the Schools,<note place="margin">See chap. 3. n. 3, 4.</note> concerning the Relativeneſs of the Divine Perſons; and ſhew the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter's Miſtakes in this Article, the Novelty of this Opinion, not aſſerted, as I verily believe, by any one ſingle Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Writer for more than a Thouſand Years after Chriſt; and give, as I am fully ſatisfied, unanſwerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> I enquire into that Queſtion,<note place="margin">See chap. 3. n. 5.</note> Why the Divine Perſons are Three and no more; and give a juſt Solution of it from Revelation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See chap. 3. n. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> I diſcuſs that Important and Fundamental En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry in this Myſtery, <hi>viz.</hi> What it is which determines the Singularity or Plurality of the Predication of any Attribute concerning the Divine Perſons? Where I firſt give the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations themſelves, which are to be ſolved. A very neceſſary matter to be known by all who pretend to give us an Hypotheſis to ſolve the Sacred Myſtery of the Trinity. [To do otherwiſe, is to make a Key for a Lock, by the Key-hole only: Such a Key is a mere ſhew, 'tis Ten thouſand to one that it never fits the Wards:] Secondly, I conſider the Anſwers of the Schools, and ſhew their Inſufficiency. Laſtly, I endeavour to give the true Solution my ſelf.</p>
            <p>It is very weak to make an Outcry about a ſingle Phraſe, how unuſual ſoever, to charge it in the Title of a Book, with the odious name of <hi>Tritheiſm,</hi> and in a Preface to the Two <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities with <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> with being a <hi>New Chriſtianity:</hi> Determine the General Queſtion firſt, and this latter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Phraſe of <hi>Three Infinite Minds,</hi> will be ſolved of

            <p>Nay further, to convince the Animadverter that it is Truth and not Victory which I contend for, my Hypotheſis is, That <hi>the Divine Perſons are Three Diſtinct Beings:</hi> His, That <hi>they are only Three Modes of One Being.</hi> I give him free leave to chuſe any one Argument which he thinks the ſtrongeſt for his own Hypotheſis, and which is ſufficient for a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Controverſy; and I faithfully promiſe him, That if I cannot ſatisfactorily ſolve it to any unprejudiced Perſon, I will not only ſtop my Pen for the future, but openly and plainly Recant what I have already Publiſhed to the contrary. <hi>Errare poſſum, Haereticus eſſe nolo:</hi> Which I ſpeak not to curry-favour with the Animadverter, in his own words, <hi>to creep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet,</hi> while I am Writing againſt him.</p>
            <p>I freely acknowledge, That my Genius (my Education, or my Negligence) never led me to Study Criticiſm in words, even in my native Language, leſs in the Learned Languages.</p>
            <p>I give him therefore not only the right hand as to theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, (that would be a very poor praiſe) but allow him the Honour the World gives to an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity Orator, to Dr. <hi>S — th,</hi> whom moſt think near of Kin to the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter.</p>
            <p>But Humility is an excellent ballaſt to great Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>Non omnia poſſumus omnes,</hi> is a Rule excepts very few. If the Author of the <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> and of <hi>Tritheiſm Charged,</hi> &amp;c. be the ſame, as I verily believe, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter's Criticiſm in Philoſophy, and mine in Philology, may be put in the balance together.</p>

            <p>The Major of this Propoſition is falſe; but what other fault to find with it, was paſt my Skill in Logick; I therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the Animadverter in the following words.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Alas!

            <p>In all Syllogiſms there is a <hi>Major,</hi> and <hi>Minor,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Terminus.</hi> It is clear that <hi>[Three Diſtinct Gods]</hi> is the middle Term as not entring the Concluſion.

            <p>Now let me ask this great Logician, Can there be a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a Propoſition, (as this is) without a Subject and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate? that is, in other words, Can there be an Affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and nothing affirmed; a Negation, and nothing denied?

the Reader's time, and abuſe his patience, to teach this great Dictator in Philoſophy and Divinity, the firſt Rudiments of Logick; the Verb ſubſtantive <hi>eſt</hi> or <hi>ſunt</hi> in Latine, is in theſe Caſes <hi>reſolvendum hoc modo,</hi> ſays <hi>Dutrieu,</hi>

               <q rend="margQuotes">[I know well enough how this <hi>Socinian</hi> Syllogiſm muſt be ſupplied and perfected; and therefore (though it is not my buſineſs to correct his Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but to expoſe them) I ſhall ſet it right for him thus. Three diſtinct infinite intelligent Perſons are three diſtinct Gods; but Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are not three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Gods, and therefore Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are not three infinite intelligent Perſons. Thus I ſay this <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> ought to proceed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Animadverter has changed the whole Syllogiſm; the Concluſion was univerſal, or equivalent to univerſal in the firſt form; in this laſt it is particular; in the former it was ſimply, univerſally denied, that there are any infinite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Perſons in the Godhead; in the latter, it is only particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly denied, that Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are infinite intelligent Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the Concluſion of the laſt Syllogiſm, not the Subject, but the Predicate was to be ſupplied; Three infinite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Perſons in the former Syllogiſm was the Subject, and not Predicate of the Concluſion; whereas in the Animadverter's Syllogiſm, he has made three infinite Perſons the Predicate; From whence it is plain, that this profound Logician, who ſo often upbraids others with the want of Logick, does not yet know the Subject and Predicate of a Propoſition; the Subject
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:66343:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
commonly precedes the Verb or <hi>copula,</hi> and the Predicate commonly follows; but let me tell this great Critick, that this Rule is not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, and I find that he cannot yet tell when it fails. And now let the Animadverter jeer others of their miſtakes in Orthography, and the like ſlips more tenderly for the future, ſince I perſuade my ſelf, that <hi>a Syllogiſm with two terms,</hi> and <hi>a Propoſition with one term,</hi> (which is included in the former) will not eaſily be forgotten or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to ſuch an inſulting Adverſary.</p>
            <p>Shall I be pardoned, if I add one Error in Divinity out of the ſame Book?

            </p>
            <p>How often do the ſacred Scriptures tell us, that <hi>God ſent his Son, gave his only begotten Son?</hi> Are theſe Expreſſions abſurd and illogical? I bluſh to relate ſuch blaſphemous ſtuff, ſince I challenge the Animadverter any other ways to expound them, than by the term of the <hi>Father, viz.</hi> The Father ſent his Son, gave his only begotten Son.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour, Truth it ſelf, ſays, <hi>I am the Son of God.</hi> Is this an abſurd and illogical Expreſſion? ſince the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted meaning of theſe words are, <hi>I am the Son of the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That to us there is one God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Bleſſed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Are all theſe abſurd and illogical?</p>
            <p>Does not Scripture, all the Creeds, uſe the Expreſſion of <hi>God the Father?</hi> Had the Animadverter that skill in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick he ſo often upbraids others with the want of, he would have known, that <hi>God the Father</hi> is equivalent in Logick to this, that <hi>God is a Father,</hi> and if <hi>a Father, the Father:</hi> He would have underſtood, that if this Propoſition be true, <hi>The Father is God,</hi> it is by the Rules of Logick capable of a converſion, of putting the Predicate in the place of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:66343:7"/>
and of the Subject in the place of the Predicate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration of the <hi>ſigna Logica, [omnis, nullus, aliquis,</hi> &amp;c.] where the Subject and Predicate are both ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, as I believe them in this Propoſition, <hi>The Father is God,</hi> and I have the conſent of the Schools on my ſide. And where the Predicate is a <hi>terminus communis,</hi> as the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter contends that <hi>God</hi> is, there a particular ſign is to be added to the Predicate when it becomes the Subject, as <hi>Peter</hi> is a Man, ſome Man is <hi>Peter:</hi> And now I leave it with the Animadverter to conſider, whether he will ſpeak with the Scriptures, the Catholick Church, the Schools, in ſaying, that <hi>God is the Father,</hi> or condemn all theſe for abſurd and illogical Dances, and declare that we ought to ſay, that <hi>ſome particular God is the Father,</hi> as ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Man is <hi>Peter.</hi> I challenge him to avoid one of theſe Phraſes, if he can, by the Rules of Logick, unleſs he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Divinity of the Father, denies that <hi>the Father is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Expreſſions of Scripture confute what the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter tells us,<note place="margin">Tritheiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 130.</note> that <hi>the term [three intelligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons] is adequately and convertibly predicated of [God.]</hi> For whatever is adequately and convertibly predicated of any term, may in all Propoſitions be put in the place of that term, according to which Rule we may ſay, that <hi>three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Perſons ſent his Son, gave his only begotten Son;</hi> That our Saviour is <hi>the Son of three intelligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

               <hi>at all about you, and below you, at an unſufferable rate?</hi> Is this the Character <hi>of ſo Learned, and every way Excellent a Clergy,</hi> not to oppoſe, moſt to overlook, nay, ſome to countenance and advance the Author of the worſt of Hereſies <hi>Tritheiſm</hi> it ſelf? You explain your ſelf (<hi>p.</hi> 361.) (when you call the late Learned and Worthy Archbiſhop of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Memory, <hi>his Great Lord and Patron</hi>) whom you here deſigned by thoſe words, and advancing the Author <hi>for them</hi> too. I need add but one place more at preſent, <hi>p.</hi> 379. where you tell the Reader, <hi>how thin a Bottom</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Dean has to ſupport him. But it ſeems Coward-like, in my apprehenſion, to accuſe the Reverend Dean as a Perſon of ſo thin a Bottom, and yet immediately in the ſame page to declare, <hi>That if any one beſides him, ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt an Anſwer to your Diſcourſe, you ſhall not in the leaſt trouble nor concern your ſelf about him, whoſoever he be:</hi> You mean probably, that you will not in Print Anſwer any ſuch Diſcourſe; but it is not always in our power to avoid being troubled or concerned.</p>
            <p>However, if that will do you any kindneſs, I deſign not an Anſwer to your Animadverſions ſo far as they are perſonal betwixt the Reverend Dean and your ſelf. The Reverend Dean needs not ſo weak a Pen as mine to defend him: His own is beſt able to chaſtiſe you, if that Learned Perſon were not better imployed, more to the Glory of God, and the Service of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66343:12"/>If the Novelty of the phraſe of <hi>three infinite Minds,</hi> ſtartled many of our Clergy; I do aſſure you, That yours <hi>of three Modes</hi> has diſpleaſed more; not one, whom I have had the honour to conſult, but are better reconciled to three infinite Minds, ſince the reading of your eighth Chapter, than they were before. They believed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle without enquiring into the <hi>Modus:</hi> But if they muſt determine the <hi>Modus;</hi> if they muſt chuſe to profeſs three infinite Minds, or only three Modes; The former is an intelligible Notion: There is a difficulty indeed how to reconcile this with the Article of the Unity of God; but the latter is to moſt meer Metaphyſical Cant. They believe, and can readily underſtand that each diſtinct Divine Perſon is an infinite Mind; from whence the Conſequence lies fair, that three diſtinct Divine Perſons are three diſtinct infinite Minds: But they cannot in the leaſt comprehend, how a Divine Perſon can be a Mode, which you expreſly affirm, <hi>p.</hi> 121. <hi>A Perſon here</hi> [in this Myſtery] <hi>imports only a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or Mode of Subſiſtence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>My deſign is, by God's aſſiſtance, to vindicate this great Article <hi>of a Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> againſt the <hi>Socinians.</hi> The Church, by God's Providence, has overcome the <hi>Arian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, a much more ſubtle Hereſy than that of the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> which perſwaded me, that treading in the ſteps of the Ancients was the beſt way to defend the Orthodox Faith at preſent. It was a great ſurpriſe to me in my Enquiry, to find, 1ſt, that thoſe things which at this day are eſteemed as the greateſt Objections againſt this Sacred Article, had a quite different import in the Judgment of the Ancients. 2dly, That all theſe Subtilties which the Schools have taught us in this Myſtery, were utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to Antiquity; nay, in many of them the direct contrary Concluſion moſt expreſly maintained by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church. 3dly, That the Subtilties of the Schools were little ſtudied by the Moderns; theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66343:12"/>
were no ſmall confirmation of this point; the Animadverter having in ſo many places, and in the moſt material Articles, not underſtood the Hypotheſis of the Schools, which yet at the ſame time he would be thought to embrace, and ſhelter himſelf under. 4thly, That the Article of the Trinity is ſafe, without recurring to the Scholaſtick Subtilties.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible, that to clear all this, is a difficult Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and I heartily wiſh this Lot had fallen to an Abler Hand: I am ſo conſcious of my own Defects, that nothing but Zeal for that Eternal Truth of this Article, in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of which I hope to be ſaved, could have tempted me to expoſe my ſelf and my own Deficiencies to the Cenſure of the world. It often pleaſes the Divine Providence by weak means to bring to paſs great effects. If it ſhall pleaſe his Infinite Wiſdom to uſe ſo weak an Inſtrument as my ſelf to illuſtrate this great Truth, or at leaſt to incite by me ſome Abler Perſon to adorn this Great Myſtery as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, To God and his Great Name be all the Glory; and I ſhall then ſit down contentedly, joyfully, with the Shame which any Miſtake or Error of mine may bring to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Faith of the moſt Learned Fathers of the Church, if I aright apprehend them; that Faith at leaſt which I embrace and propoſe, is, That the Extra Scriptural Terms uſed by the Church in this Great and Sacred Article, <hi>viz. Trinity, Perſon, Hypoſtaſis, Conſubſtantial Eſſence,</hi> are to be received and underſtood in the moſt proper, native, and genuine Senſe of thoſe Terms; that is, in the ſame Senſe in which they were underſtood, when by the ſame Fathers they were applied to Angelical or Human Perſons: And this, I conceive, in Senſe to imply no more than what the ſame Fathers declared concerning the following Scriptural Expreſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Father, Son, Spirit, Begotten, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, Son of God, Spirit of God, Begotten Son of God,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66343:13"/>
are to be properly expounded, and not in ſome improper, uncouth, figurative, or Metaphorical Senſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall divide my Deſign into Two Parts. In the Firſt I ſhall endeavour to give an Account of all the Metaphyſical Terms uſed in this Myſtery, and as far as is neceſſary, of the Subtilties which the Schoolmen have introduced in their Explication of them; and this I have choſen to do by way of Animadverſion upon our Animadverter, from a double Reaſon: Firſt, in relation to himſelf, to convince him, if poſſible, of his Barbarous Treatment of a Worthy and Reverend Perſon, for barely venturing on a new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in a Vindication of this Sacred Article: The Piety of the Deſign, with all Candid and Ingenuous Lovers of the Article, would have attoned for a much greater <hi>Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. Three Infinite Minds or Spirits</hi> is capable of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Expoſition, even in the mouth of a Schoolman. However, the Animadverter, of all perſons, ought to have been ſilent, or the laſt to have found fault with it, who has ſo often been guilty of greater Slips both in Philoſophy and Divinity. Secondly, In relation to the <hi>Socinian</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian, who by his Commendation of the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions has adopted them for his own, and from his own words is bound to defend them for an Acurate Account of what the Church and Schools have taught in this Myſtery; or elſe confeſs, that he has oppoſed (poſſibly, forſook) the Faith of the Church (and Schools) before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood either.</p>
            <p>In my Second Part I intend to enquire more carefully into that unconteſted Article of <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of God;</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince I am verily perſuaded, that moſt of the Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not to ſay, Perplexities, wherewith this Article of the Trinity is too often obſcured, ariſe from want of a juſt ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that Firſt Article of Natural Religion, the Unity of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66343:13"/>It will be an eaſe both to my Reader and my ſelf, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide my Firſt Part into Chapters and numbred Sections, and be more ready in caſe of any occaſion of Reference or Compariſon.</p>
            <p>My deſign will alſo apologize for me, if I ſometimes take occaſion to digreſs much farther than a bare Anſwer to the Animadverſions ſeems to require; ſince my deſire is to bring, as far as I conveniently can, all Metaphyſical or Nice Diſputes into this Firſt Part, that my Second Part may be more ſuited for the uſe of thoſe perſons who are leſs acquainted, or leſs delight in theſe Terms of Art.</p>
            <p>I alſo crave leave to acquaint the Reader, that for the avoiding of unneceſſary Diſputes, I judge it ſufficient at this time to reduce the Queſtion to what is owned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed on both ſides. As for inſtance: Both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> acknowledge one Divine Perſon: Both alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God's relation to his Creatures. If therefore the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Relations within the Trinity are capable of the ſame Solution with the Relation of God to his Creatures; I mean, in reſpect of their Real Exiſtence, that ſufficeth for my purpoſe. So if the Suppoſitality of Three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be capable of the ſame Solution with the Suppoſitality of One Divine Perſon; whether that Suppoſitality be a Mode or Negation, I need not in my preſent Deſign ſtrictly determine.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He has confounded Predicamental and Phyſical Accidents. Even thoſe Metaphyſicians and Schoolmen, who aſſerted Accidents to be diſtinct Beings from Subſtance, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtood that aſſertion in large of all the Predicamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Accidents, but only of quantity and quality.

He names three kinds of Modal difference, two of which are falſe, and all three impertinent. <hi>Firſt,</hi> two Modes, when they belong to one Being, differ indeed by a Modal difference; but when we ſpeak of them indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, as they belong to different Beings, they differ by the ſame difference by which the Beings themſelves differ, that is, by a ſtrictly real difference. The perſonalities of different perſons always differ by the ſame difference by which the perſons themſelves differ, that is, by a ſtrictly real difference. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> of a Being, differing from its own Mode, is acknowledged to him. The <hi>third,</hi> viz. the difference of ſeveral things modified or affected, is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Animadverter, never any Philoſopher dreamed, that ſeveral things differ by a modal difference, they always differ by a ſtrictly real difference. However the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter has here ſpoke a very great truth, That the Divine Perſons differ as ſeveral things, but this utterly overthrows the Animadverter's Hypotheſis: According to him, the Divine Perſons differ not as ſeveral things; but as one and the ſame Being under one Mode differs from it ſelf under another Mode, this is the only modal difference the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter's Hypotheſis requires, and this with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundneſs of judgment he here omits. The other three are nothing to the purpoſe, had they been all never ſo true in Philoſophy.</p>

               <p>Some few Schoolmen, who have ſuppoſed that the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature of Chriſt wanted a Proper or Created Exiſtence, have aſſerted, That Exiſtence is a Mode in Created Beings; that is, ſomething added to the Thing or

The generality believe that Exiſtence, is only the Actuality of the Thing or Being, and that all it adds to the Being is only a Negation, in the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter's words, that the Being is not actually included in any Cauſe.</p>
               <p>But not one ſingle Divine, I firmly believe, before his own dear ſelf, ever affirmed that Exiſtence was a proper Mode in God: His very next words confute this aſſertion, <hi>p.</hi> 34. that Exiſtence is neceſſarily included in his very Eſſence, but a Mode, a thing added to the Eſſence, cannot be included in the Eſſence.

               </p>
               <p>Subſiſtence is ſtrictly a Mode of Exiſtence; that is, it modifies the Exiſtence of a Subſtance, and diſtinguiſhes the Exiſtence of a complete Subſtance, from the Exiſtence of an incomplete Subſtance or Part.

               <p>The Animadverter did not underſtand, or not conſider the relation of an Adjunct to a Subject, or he would never have made this Application in reference to the Hypoſtatic Union of the Humane Nature of Chriſt to the Perſon of the WORD.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Animadverter confutes himſelf, when he tells us, That the Humane Nature of Chriſt exiſts <hi>in</hi> the Perſon of the <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>This difficulty is not peculiar to the Aſſerters of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Divine Perſons: They who acknowledge but one Divine Perſon in the Godhead, are equally concerned in this queſtion, Whether the Subſiſtence (of one or more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons) added to the Divine Nature, infers a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in a Divine Perſon?</p>
               <p>The Animadverter confeſſes, That in all finite Perſons, Subſiſtence and Nature infer a Compoſition; he means a modal Compoſition, a Compoſition of Subſtance and Mode: This manifeſtly increaſes the difficulty, how a Subſtance and Mode ſhould not be a modal Compoſition in a Divine Perſon. He tells you, indeed it does not; if we pleaſe, we may take his word; if not, his thoughts and words can reach no higher. But by his leave, I ſhall conſider this point more carefully.</p>
               <p>All Compoſition is <hi>Diſtinctorum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nio,</hi> ſo as to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſome whole, that is, in Compoſition there muſt be an Union, and alſo the ſeveral things united, muſt in ſome ſenſe be component parts, otherwiſe we could not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Compoſition from a bare local Union. Now, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66343:21"/>
to the Animadverter, the Divine Nature or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is one thing, and the Mode another, (a Mode is to him a thing added) and a Divine Perſon a whole; ſo that it is manifeſt, according to him, that there muſt be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Compoſition in a Divine Perſon, in God, in a pure ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple act which is void of all Compoſition.</p>
               <p>Nay, further, thoſe Schoolmen who aſſert theſe real Modes, reduce ſome of them to Subſtance, ſome of them to the accidental Predicaments. Thoſe Modes which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately adhere to Subſtance, as Exiſtence, Subſiſtence, they reduce to the predicament of Subſtance; thoſe Modes which complete Subſtance it ſelf, cannot be any thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, of a different kind and nature from Subſtance; and yet they cannot be perfect Subſtances, for then they would want other Modes to perfect them; but they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe each of theſe Modes a <hi>ſubſtantiale quid,</hi> a ſubſtantial thing, tho not ſo perfect as Subſtance. So again, thoſe Modes which perfect an Accident, are each of them <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentale quid,</hi> ſomething accidental, tho not a perfect Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. Now I freely profeſs, that I have no Notion of this <hi>ſubſtantiale quid,</hi> which is not a perfect Subſtance; nor of an <hi>accidentale quid,</hi> which yet is not a perfect Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. However, from this Explication of theſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers minds, it is manifeſt that a Subſtance and Mode in finite Perſons, infer a Compoſition of a Subſtance, and a diſtinct <hi>ſubſtantiale quid.</hi>

They anſwer, That the Abſolute and Relative Subſtance are not united, but identified one with another, this being an Axiom to the Schoolmen,<note place="margin">Suarez lib. 4. de Trin. cap. 2.

But then comes the grand Difficulty of all; If each diſtinct Relative Subſtance be the ſame, or identified with the one ſingular abſolute Divine Nature, are not the three Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from thence identified one with another? Is not this an infallible Axiom in reaſon, <hi>Quae ſunt eadem uni tertio, ſunt eadem inter ſe.</hi> This is the Gordian Knot, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Schoolman gives a different anſwer to; but at laſt they are generally obliged to cut it, and deny the truth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66343:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Axiom in the Divine Nature. I thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to give this account of the Opinions of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to ſhew the Animadverter, how little reaſon he had to lay ſo great a ſtreſs upon the Metaphyſicks of Modes. Nothing was farther from the thoughts of the Schoolmen (with whoſe Names he flouriſhes ſo often) than to believe that there were true Modes in God. The Divine Relations, according to them, were only Modes in Name, or in our imperfect Conception of them.</p>
               <p>As for my own private Opinion, with all ſubmiſſion to better Information, I conceive, That Exiſtence in a finite Perſon or Being, much more in a Divine Perſon, is only the actuality of a Perſon or Being. That Subſiſtence adds only a Negation of incompleteneſs to ſubſtantial Exiſtence even in finite Perſons, and conſequently infers no ſort of Compoſition in them; and therefore much leſs infers a Compoſition in a Divine Perſon.</p>
               <p>Again, I do believe that all predicamental Relations amongſt the Creatures, are no poſitive Modes, but only external Denominations; the ſame which the Schoolmen are obliged to affirm of the Relations of the Divine Perſons to the Creatures: Nor can I ſee any Abſurdity of extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame concluſion to the Internal Relations, as the Schoolmen call them. As for inſtance, The Relation of Paternity may juſtly (as I conceive) be ſtiled an extrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Denomination; extrinſical (I ſay, not to the ſacred Triad, but) to the Perſon of the Father, who is denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by it; and (in the ſame ſenſe) Filiation extrinſical to the Perſon of the Son, and Proceſſion extrinſical to the Perſon of the bleſſed Spirit. This naturally and eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends the Simplicity of a Divine Perſon; this frees us of endleſs and inextricable Queſtions, which fill up every page of the Scholaſtical Writers. This forces us not to hide our ſelves in a Cloud of Words, which ſignify nothing. A Subſtance, and a Mode, ſays the Animadverter, infer
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66343:22"/>
not Compoſition in a Divine Perſon, becauſe in him the Subſtance and Mode <hi>coaleſce into one by an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,</hi> that is, in other words, they infer not Compoſition, becauſe they are compounded. Compoſition and Coaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing into One by an Union and Conjunction, differ no more than <hi>Definitum</hi> and Definition: It is truly therefore incomprehenſible and ineffable, that a coaleſcing into one by an Union and Conjunction ſhould not be a Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Whatever differs really, differs alſo formally; but here by formal difference, the Animadverter underſtands that difference which is only formal and not real: Now in this ſenſe of the term, the expreſs contrary Concluſion is true, That whatſoever things are (only) formally different, are therefore affirmable of one another. The Concluſion the Animadverter ought to have deduced from his Premiſes, is, That Mind, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, (<hi>viz.</hi> in God) are not <hi>formally</hi> affirmable of one another: But it is <hi>Fallacia à dicto ſecundum quid, ad dictum ſimpliciter,</hi> to put the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in place of the ſecond, to ſay, That Mind, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, are not <hi>(ſimply)</hi> affirmable of one another, becauſe it will be acknowledged, that they are not <hi>formally</hi> affirmable of one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas the Animadverter tells us, That <hi>in ſpeaking of Things, the formal Differences of them muſt ſtill be attended to;</hi> We need no other Confutation of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, than his own immediate following words, <hi>viz. That God's Juſtice, and his Mercy, are one pure ſimple Act
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66343:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in him.</hi> His Juſtice, and his Mercy, are formally (or in our way of Conception) two diſtinct, nay, two oppoſite Acts; it is only in the Reality, that we affirm them to be one pure ſimple Act in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If things only formally different, are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmable of one another, there could be no Propoſitions but identical ones, or at moſt, where the Subject and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate are ſynonimous Terms. No man could ſay without abſurdity, That the Father is God, becauſe theſe two terms, Father and God formally differ; and therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this wiſe Rule of our Animadverter, are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmable of one another.</p>
               <p>Has the Animadverter never heard of the Diſtinction of <hi>Senſus Identicus,</hi> and <hi>Senſus Formalis?</hi> This Propoſition, <hi>God's Juſtice is his Mercy,</hi> is true <hi>Senſu Identico,</hi> tho not <hi>Senſu Formali.</hi>

               <p>We are cautioned indeed by the Learned, that we avoid Concluſions which are only true <hi>Senſu Identico,</hi> when ſuch way of ſpeaking is againſt common Cuſtom, or when the formal Senſe carries a formal Oppoſition, as in the Divine Attributes of Juſtice and Mercy; and the reaſon they give, is, becauſe in ſuch inſtances the Propoſitions lead to a formal Senſe, in which Senſe they are falſe.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Nature.</hi> That all this is ſaid, as I verily believe, without an Adverſary. The Reverend Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s does not once in his Vindication of the B. Trinity, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm either the one, or the other of theſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He asks no more of his Reader, if I miſunderſtand him not, ſave to acknowledge, That a diſtinct Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs is a firm proof of the Diſtinction of Perſons in this Sacred Myſtery; and that a ſingular Mutual-Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is an equal proof of the Singularity of the Divine Nature. I conceive, That the Reverend Dean never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to deny, that the Diſtinction of Perſons is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature before their diſtinct acts of Self-Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or that their Unity of Nature is in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Priority before their ſingular Mutual-Conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but only intended that <hi>quoad nos,</hi> or in our way of Knowledge or Conception, their diſtinct Self Conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs proved, or was known to us before their diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality, and their ſingular mutual Conſciouſneſs in order of our Knowledge, before the Knowledge of their Unity of Nature.</p>
               <p>In the Animadverter's Third Chapter,<note place="margin">N. 2.</note> he endeavours to prepare the way, by denying that Self-Conſciouſneſs is the formal reaſon of perſonality in finite, created Perſons.

The utmoſt their Hypotheſis will allow them to pretend to, is, That the Humane Nature of Chriſt is not a diſtinct Perſon from the Perſon of the WORD.

To explain this a little.</p>
               <p>The Schoolmen, who under pain of Hereſy, aſſert but one ſingular abſolute Subſtance in the Trinity, found a great and almoſt inſuperable difficulty ſo to explain the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that only the Perſon of the WORD, and not the whole Trinity, was incarnated, or became Man. This is an obvious enquiry, What it is which was immediately uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Humane Nature of Chriſt, ſo as to denominate Chriſt both God and Man? To aſſert, that the ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Divine Nature was immediately united to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, was to aſſert the Incarnation of the whole Trinity, ſince whatever belongs to the common Divine Nature immediately, belongs equally to the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; it remains therefore, according to them, that only the Mode of Subſiſtence of the WORD was immediately united to the Humane Nature. This Anſwer has viſibly many difficulties in it, which may be conſidered hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Now I am only to enquire, how it denies the Humane Nature of Chriſt to be a diſtinct Perſon from the Perſon of the WORD. The Humane and Divine Nature of Chriſt have, ſay they, but one ſingular Mode of Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Well, grant that poſſible; What follows? The School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay, that then they are not two diſtinct Perſons. I cannot for my life ſee the Conſequence. That Maxim of the Law, <hi>Quando duo jura concurrunt in una perſona, oequum eſt ac ſi concurrerent in duobus,</hi> may be, as I conceive, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied here. If we ſuppoſe it poſſible for one Perſonality to conſtitute two diſtinct Natures, each a Perſon, it is a meer wrangle of a term, to deny theſe two Natures to be two diſtinct Perſons; they have all the Properties of two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num per Accidens.</hi> So a Man cloathed is the ſame Man with himſelf naked; and yet a Man cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a Man naked, differ as Simple and Compound. A Soul in a ſtate of Separation, is the ſame Soul with the Soul cloathed with an Human Body. I am aſhamed to be obliged to prove ſo plain a Concluſion: In an Hypoſtatical Union, the inferior Nature is ſo far an Adjunct to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Nature, that what the WORD was before the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or the Soul before its cloathing with a Body, the ſame each remains after the Union or Conjunction. It is in ſome ſenſe a Part, otherwiſe the Union could not be ſubſtantial, but accidental. The WORD could with no more propriety be ſaid to be a Man, than a Man may be denominated an evil Angel, becauſe he is poſſeſſed of ſuch.</p>
               <p>Had the Divine and Human Nature of Chriſt been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, or the Soul and Body of Man ſo mixt, as to have denominated the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of a different Nature from the component Parts; then the WORD, and the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> could not be one Perſon, nor the Soul and the Man the ſame Perſon. But we maintain an Hypoſtatical Union, and not a confuſion of Subſtance or Nature.</p>
               <p>That which has obſcured the Analogy betwixt the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the two Natures in the One Perſon of Chriſt, and of the Soul and Body in Man, is, for that in this latter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Cuſtom has prevailed with us to ſay, That an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Perſon has but one, <hi>viz.</hi> an human Nature. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as an Human Perſon properly conſiſts of two unconfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Natures; (the Nature of the Soul and Body are not confounded in the Hypoſtatical Compoſition of Man.) The Learned <hi>Damaſcen,</hi>

Perſons poſſeſs the ſame common Nature; whence we ſay, That two or more Human Perſons are of one and the ſame nature. As alſo, That if the Holy Spirit had been incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted equally with the WORD, we might have ſaid that the WORD incarnate is of the ſame nature with the Holy Ghoſt incarnate.</p>
               <p>To conclude, All Philoſophers aſſert, That a <hi>totum</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers only <hi>ratione</hi> from all its parts united; if therefore it be poſſible for the ſuperior part in an Hypoſtatick Union to retain all the Natural Perfections of a <hi>ſuppoſitum</hi> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and for an inferior part to be united to the ſuperior, without confuſion of its Nature, and yet not as a diſtinct <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum,</hi> but as an <hi>inſtrumentum</hi> or <hi>principium quo</hi> to the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or part: It will then evidently follow, That the whole <hi>compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum,</hi> is but one <hi>ſuppoſitum,</hi> but one Perſon, and the very ſame Perſon, which the ſuperior part was before the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that a ſimple and compounded Perſon is in ſuch inſtance not two Perſons, but one and the ſame Perſon differing (not really, but) modally from himſelf, by ſuch difference by which a Learned Man differs from himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Learned.</p>

                  <q rend="margQuotes">[And here I ſuppoſe ſome will object,<note place="margin">P. 78. lin. 1.

To which, I anſwer, That an actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence in a Compound, is not the only Condition which makes the thing a part, but its eſſential relation to a Compound; which relation is founded partly upon its original deſignation, and partly upon its natural aptitude to be an ingredient in the conſtitution of a Compound.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Objection lies very obvious, That the Soul in a ſtate of ſeparation is a Perſon as ſubſiſting by it ſelf, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part in any Whole, nor an adjunct to any Subject,<note place="margin">Animad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 34.</note> which is his own Definition of ſubſiſtence or perſonality.

notwithſtanding it exiſts in no <hi>whole.</hi> Now in Logicks, <hi>totum</hi> and <hi>pars, whole</hi> and <hi>part,</hi> are Relatives, and mutually infer one another. There can no more then be a Part without an actual Whole, than a Son without a Father. <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>originally deſigned</hi> by God to be a Father, and had a natural aptitude to become ſuch; What then? Will the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or any one elſe affirm, That he was a Father before he had a Son, as the Animadverter here tells us, That the Soul in a ſtate of ſeparation is a part, tho there is no whole to which ſuch part can belong?</p>
               <p>However, <hi>Secondly,</hi> I confeſs that there is more of truth in this Anſwer than, I believe, the Animadverter was aware of, <hi>viz.</hi> That when to be a Part and a Perſon are oppoſed as Contradictions, We do not take this Term Part in a nice Logical ſenſe of the Term, but in a Phyſical ſenſe, for an incomplete Being, which naturally requires to be compleated, perfected by ſome other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. And thus his own Anſwer will be ſtrongly retorted againſt himſelf, <hi>viz. That an actual Inexiſtence in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, is not that which abſolutely denies any thing to be a Perſon, but its exiſting incompleatly in the Compoſition, its Exiſtence</hi> ad modum adjuncti inſtrumenti, vel principii quo, <hi>to ſome ſuperior nature.</hi> Now in this ſenſe the WORD is not a Part, the WORD is not perfected, compleated by the Compoſition.

               </p>
               <p>Let the Animadverter anſwer this, and he anſwers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. A Simple and Compounded Perſon may as well be the ſame Perſon, as a Simple and Compounded Being be the ſame Being. Theſe two differ modally, and not really.</p>
               <p>And now to return from the Myſtery of the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">N. 10.</note> to that of the Sacred Trinity, and to the Queſtion the Animadverter is conſidering as preparatory to it; <hi>viz.</hi> What is the Formal Reaſon of Perſonality in Finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Perſons?

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66343:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
indefinite, univerſal Attribute; but to be the Perſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> is proper to the firſt Man.</p>
               <p>That which ſtrictly and properly denominates <hi>Adam</hi> a Perſon, is a Mode of Subſiſtence, <hi>totale Attributum,</hi> the being a compleat Whole, as the Fathers often ſpeak.</p>
               <p>That which denominates <hi>Adam</hi> the particular Perſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> is unknown to us; that which the Schoolmen call <hi>Haecceity,</hi> cannot be defined.

               <p>To apply this to the Divine Perſons, 'tis a double En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, What denominates the Father a Perſon; and what denominates him the Perſon of the Father.

Paternity, to be unbegotten, to ſend his Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates him the particular Perſon of the Father.</p>
               <p>This laſt Queſtion is what the Fathers were chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in. The <hi>Noetianiſts,</hi> the <hi>Patri-Paſſianiſts,</hi> rarely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed the Perſonality of Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt.

None can imagine that that Being which is God, is either an Accident, a Part, or, to pleaſe the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter, an Adjunct to any other Being. Thoſe only deny the Perſonality, who eſteem the Son and Holy Spirit, that is, each of them, not properly God, but ſomething in God, the Perſonal Word or Wiſdom of God the Father, or his Perſonal Power.</p>
               <p>This was the great Controverted Debate, Whether the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, that is, whether Each of them was a <hi>Diſtinct Perſon?</hi> and conſequently whether they were Three Perſons? Now Paternity, ſay the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, in this ſenſe conſtituted the Father a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Divine Perſon: The Schoolmen change the Queſtion, and ſay, That it conſtituted him a Perſon: In the ſame ſenſe, Filiation, according to the Ancients, conſtituted the Son a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Perſon; and Proceſſion, Sanctification, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Holy Spirit a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Perſon from Father and Son.</p>
               <p>This Obſervation will be of great uſe to any one who ſhall read the Ancients concerning the Perſonality of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This the Animadverter lays down as a Rule to guide our Diſcourſes concerning the Divine Perſons. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That theſe Conſiderations contain a direct Hereſy, the expreſs Hereſy of <hi>Sabellius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Animadverter himſelf notoriouſly breaks theſe Rules, even where he ought to have kept them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is the direct Hereſy of <hi>Sabellius</hi> to aſſert, That there is no <hi>Prius</hi> and <hi>Poſterius</hi> between the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>The Compiler of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed denies a <hi>Prius</hi> or <hi>Poſterius</hi> in the Trinity, in reference to Duration or Time; they are all three Co-eternal. But to deny a <hi>Prius</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66343:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Poſterius</hi> in Original, is to deny that there is a Father and Son in the Trinity.</p>
               <p>Again, it is very pleaſant for the Animadverter to tell us, That this <hi>Prius</hi> and <hi>Poſterius</hi> is founded in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Reaſon</hi> of things, and yet denies it in the Divine Nature. As if Univerſal Reaſon did not reach infinite as well as finite Nature. I ſuppoſe he means, That there is a natural Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Prius</hi> and <hi>Poſterius</hi> founded in the particular reaſon of finite Natures, which makes no <hi>Prius</hi> or <hi>Poſterius</hi> in the infinite Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>And it is as pleaſant to hear him telling us, That this natural Order of <hi>Prius</hi> and <hi>Poſterius</hi> muſt not be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in our diſcourſing of God; when in the very imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate preceding words, himſelf had contradicted it, and affirmed, that there was no <hi>Prius</hi> and <hi>Poſterius</hi> in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Himſelf moſt ſhamefully confounds this Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Order of <hi>Prius</hi> and <hi>Poſterius,</hi> when he aſſerts p. 98. <hi>That the Father is formally conſtituted a Perſon by his own perſonal Act of Generation.</hi> P. 249. That <hi>perſonal Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are properly Perſonalities.</hi> P. 250. <hi>That the Relation and Mode of Subſiſtence make but one ſingle indiviſible Mode of Being: Yet, ſays the Animadverter in the next imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate words, according to the Natural Order of conceiving things, we muſt conceive of the Subſiſtence as precedent to the Relation: For as much as Human Reaſon conſiders things ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as ſubſiſting, before it can conſider them as related to one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning of all this is, That theſe are Rules, when he hopes that he can confute the Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s. Self-Conſciouſneſs cannot be Subſiſtence, becauſe according to the natural Order of conceiving things, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the Subſiſtence before the Self-Conſciouſneſs. Self-Conſciouſneſs cannot be the formal Reaſon of Perſonality; for as much as it is a Perſonal Act, one property of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66343:33"/>
Perſon already conſtituted. Theſe are Demonſtrations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s. What pity was it, that the Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s never aſſerted this once in all his Book, for then it would have been allowed the Animadverter, that in one ſingle Article, he had been too hard for the Dean. But why are not theſe Rules to himſelf? Is not Generation as much a perſonal Act, as Self-Conſciouſneſs? Is not the Attribute of being a Father, one property of a Perſon already conſtituted? Is not this Relation founded upon, and poſterior to a perſonal Act of Generation? Can any thing, according to human Reaſon, be related before it is? I believe the Animadverter in this point muſt borrow his own words, and tell us, That <hi>his Thoughts and Words can reach no higher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Animadverter denies a <hi>Prius</hi> and <hi>Poſterius</hi> in the Divine Nature to purpoſe, when he tells us, That even <hi>Productive Principles,</hi> when uſed in reference to the Divine Perſons, that is, Father and Son, are not applicable to them in the ſtrict and proper Signification of the ſaid term. With his leave, the Father is ſtrictly and properly the productive Principle of his Son, or elſe he cannot be ſtrictly and properly the Father of his Son, or elſe he did never ſtrictly and properly beget his Son. The <hi>Arians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a proper Generation, and aſſert, That the Father is an Adoptive, Creative, and not Generative Father of his Son. The <hi>Sabellians</hi> on the other hand adulterate both the Divine Generation and Miſſion, and expound them in a figurative improper Senſe. Againſt both theſe Hereſies, the Church has ever profeſſed a true and proper Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt the Divine Perſons.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To affirm, that <hi>Self-conſciouſneſs is a Perſonal Act,</hi> is the greateſt Hereſie to the Schoolmen. A Perſonal Act is an Act proper and peculiar to ſome one Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as Generation is a Perſonal Act proper and peculiar to the Perſon of the Father, and diſtinguiſhes the Father from the Son and Holy Spirit. Now Self-conſciouſneſs is an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Attribute, and upon that account cannot be eſteemed Perſonal by the Schoolmen. Self-conſciouſneſs is but one conception of Omniſcience, and will the Animadverter ſay, That the Father has a diſtinct Perſonal Omniſcience? If he does, he multiplies Omniſcience with the Perſons, that is, he multiplies the Divine Nature in ſuch Perſon.</p>
               <p>Self-conſciouſneſs, as well as Mutual Conſciouſneſs, to the Schoolmen is an Eſſential Act: Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, according to the Schoolmen, as they have but one ſingular Divine Nature, ſo they have but one ſingular Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, but one ſingular Self-conſciouſneſs, and one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Mutual Conſciouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Every Act proceeds not only from ſome Agent, but by vertue of ſome power to produce that Act: Therefore a Perſonal Act muſt have a Perſonal Power, a Perſonal <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium quo.</hi> The Perſonal Act of Generation by the Father ſuppoſes a Perſonal Power to generate peculiar to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: A Perſonal Act of Self-conſciouſneſs therefore will imply a Perſonal Power to exert ſuch Act, that is, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Omniſcience, or a Perſonal Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>Not therefore the Phraſe of Three Infinite Minds, but the aſſerting that Self-conſciouſneſs is a Perſonal Act, does, in the Judgment of the Schoolmen, unavoidably infer Three Gods.</p>

               <p>The Antecedent, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Perſonality of every one of the Divine Perſons is purely and perfectly Relative, is alſo the General Aſſertion of the Schoolmen, as <hi>Petavius</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. de Trin. cap. 10. ſect. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Pauciſſimi quidem è Schola Theologi vel opinati ſunt, vel probabile judicant, perſonales proprietatès abſolutum non-nihil habere; à quibus meritò diſſentiunt coeteri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How univerſally ſoever this Concluſion is embraced by the Schoolmen, and from them by the Animadverter, I can ſcarce perſuade my ſelf that the Animadverter under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the meaning of the very Concluſion; this I am ſure of, That his pretended Arguments to prove this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, are the greateſt Objections againſt the truth of it, and that he all along betrays the groſſeſt Ignorance of the Schoolmens meaning. I will give the Reader his own words, and then examine them. <q rend="margQuotes">And that the Perſons in the Bleſſed Trinity are purely Relative to one another, and conſequently that their Perſonalities are ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, is no leſs evident from this, that two of them relate to one another, as Father and Son, and the third to both, as proceeding from both; and it is impoſſible for one thing to proceed from another, eſpecially by a continual act of Proceſſion, without importing a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that from which it ſo proceeds; ſo that the very Perſonal Subſiſtence implies and carries in it a formal Relation. For the Father ſubſiſts Perſonally as a Father, by that Eternal Communication of his Nature to his Son; which Act, as proceeding from him, is called Generation, and renders him formally a Father; and as terminated in the Son, is called Filiation, and conſtitutes him formally a Son; and in like manner the Holy Ghoſt ſubſiſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally by that Act of Proceſſion, by which he proceeds
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66343:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from, and relates to both the Father and the Son. So that, that proper Mode of Subſiſtence (by which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Divine Eſſence always included in it, each of them is rendred a Perſon) is wholly Relative, and ſo belongs to one of them, that it alſo bears a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reference to another. From all which it undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follows, that the Three Perſons in the Bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are in the formal Conſtitution of them Relative to one another; and conſequently, that the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonalities, by which they become formally Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and are ſo denominated, are Three Eternal Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Ancient Fathers confeſs, That the Divine Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons conſtitute each of them a diſtinct Perſon; that they enable us to conceive them diſtinct; this therefore is not the queſtion. The queſtion is, Whether the Relations conſtitute each of them a Perſon indefinitely? Spiration is a Relative Attribute in the Father, relates the Father to the Holy Spirit; but yet Spiration is not properly a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality, not properly the ſubſiſtential Form, but a ſubſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or perſonal Property. A little to examine the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter's proofs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Perſons in the Bleſſed Trinity are purely Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi> This is too much, more than ever any aſſerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. A Perſon in the Bleſſed Trinity is God, an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mind; but to be God, to be an infinite Mind, are confeſſedly abſolute Attributes. The Schoolmen ſay, That the Perſons in the Bleſſed Trinity are purely Relative in their Perſonalities, that is, purely Relative, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> or in one Reſpect. The Animadverter turns the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a ſimple Affirmation, that they are (in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) purely Relative.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Divine Perſons are purely Relative, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe two of them relate to one another, as Father and Son; and the third to both. The Animadverter knows
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66343:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not the difference betwixt a Relative Perſon, and a Perſon who ſuſtains a Relation. <hi>Adam</hi> is related to God, to <hi>Eve,</hi> to <hi>Seth;</hi> yet none ever ſtiled <hi>Adam</hi> a Relative Perſon. The Perſonality of <hi>Adam</hi> is not a Relation, but a proper Mode of Subſiſtence, which can never be conceived otherwiſe than Abſolute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Father ſubſiſts perſonally, as a Father. This is the queſtion it ſelf, and by the Rules of Logick ought to have been proved, and not ſuppoſed: The ſole Enquiry is, Whether to be a Father, and to be a Perſon, or ſubſiſt perſonally, be formally the ſame?</p>

                  </note>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Father ſubſiſts Perſonally by an Act of Generation. How can a Perſonal Act, which ſuppoſes the Perſon already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, be the formal Cauſe of Perſonality in the ſame Perſon? The Schoolmen were wiſer in their Generation; they confeſs, that if the Father is denominated a Father from his Act of Generation, it is impoſſible that the Father's Paternity ſhould be his Mode of Subſiſtence; ſince it is impoſſible not to ſuppoſe a Perſon ſubſiſting, before we can conceive of him acting. The firſt Perſon of the Trinity, ſay the Schoolmen, is not therefore a Father, becauſe he generates; but therefore generates, becauſe he is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Filiation conſtitutes the Son formally a Son; that's not the queſtion: But does Filiation conſtitute the Son a Perſon? that is the thing in debate, and which the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter ought to have proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The very Perſonal Subſiſtence of theſe Perſons implies and carries in it a formal Relation. This is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to imply a Relation, to carry in it a Relation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Animadverter means, that the Perſonal Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence is it ſelf a Relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:66343:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>Again, Subſiſtence in relation to a productive Principle, (which is all the Relation the Animadverter here mentions) is a quite different thing from Perſonal Subſiſtence. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Human Perſon ſubſiſts relatively in Relation to God, his Creator; but what is this to his Perſonality? This does not denominate an Human Perſon relative in his Perſonality. The Son and Holy Spirit relate to the Father as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive Principle; but how does this prove them Relative Perſons?</p>

                  <q rend="margQuotes">[It is certain, That to be a Father,<note place="margin">P. 101. lin. 3. N. 4.</note> is a Relative Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>A Father (as underſtood in this Myſtery, <hi>viz.</hi> as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the property of being unbegotten) can have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a productive Principle. A Father has indeed a Relation to a Son; but the natural Order of conceiving things obliges us to conceive of a Perſon as ſubſiſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can conceive him capable of the Act of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of the Relation of a Father. The Schoolmen therefore call this not a thing certain and evident, but a Myſtery; and confeſs, that unleſs the Father be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated antecedently to his Act of Generation, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the Father's being a Relative Subſiſtence or Perſon ſhould be ſo much as true.</p>
               <p>And having ſaid thus much from the Animadverter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Subtilty of the Schools, <hi>viz.</hi> the Relativeneſs of the Divine Perſons in their Perſonalities; give me leave to conſider it more generally.</p>
               <p>And, firſt, it is no ſmall prejudice with me againſt the Scholaſtick Subtilties, that in this material Article, all Antiquity for above a thouſand Years have affirmed the quite contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that to be a Perſon, is an abſolute Attribute. <hi>Petrus Abelardus, Peter Lombard,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If to be a Perſon, be a Relative Attribute, as to be a Friend is; then, according to the nature of all Relatives, the Father when denominated a Perſon, muſt be defined by his Correlate, and ſo of the other Perſons; that is to ſay, that this Phraſe, <hi>viz. The Perſon of the Father</hi> cannot ſignify the Father, but the Son: And this Phraſe, <hi>viz. The Perſon of the Son,</hi> cannot ſignify the Son, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for ſo it is in all other Relatives.

This is a juſt Conſequence of this Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtick Subtilty; I need not note the Paradoxicalneſs of it.</p>
               <p>To which I add as an Argument <hi>ad homines,</hi> to the Animadverter, and thoſe who follow the Schools, That to be a Perſon is as common to Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Animadv. p. 113.</note> as to be God is common to the Three. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this be a ſure Rule, that whatever Attribute is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, is abſolute; to be a Perſon will be an abſolute Attribute,<note place="margin">Si enim tres perſonae, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune eſt eis id quod perſona eſt. <hi>St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt lib. 7 de Trin. cap. 4.</hi>
                  </note> as certainly communicable.

               <p>The Faith of a Trinity of Divine Perſons is owing to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation alone; and from thence <hi>ex poſteriori,</hi> we learn, that a Trinity (that is, neither more nor fewer) of Divine Perſons, is neceſſary.</p>

                  </note> It is confeſt by the moſt rigid of the Schoolmen, that it is lawful to ſay, That Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are <hi>Tres Deita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem habentes, Tres Dominantes, Tres Creantes;</hi> That Father and Son are <hi>Duo Spirantes.</hi> How ſhall we extricate our ſelves out of this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?

               </p>
               <p>It's manifeſt from theſe Examples, that the diſtinction of an Eſſential and Perſonal Attribute will not ſolve this difficulty.</p>
               <p>The Schoolmen confeſs this, and therefore give us a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond diſtinction of a Noun Subſtantive and Noun Adjective, <hi>viz.</hi> That an Eſſential Attribute, when expreſt by a Noun Subſtantive, is always to be predicated ſingularly; but when the ſame Attribute is expreſt by a Noun Adjective, then it may be plurally predicated of the Divine Perſons.</p>
               <p>But I enquire, How comes this Rule alſo to hold in the Perſonal Attribute of a <hi>Spirator?</hi> Can a Criticiſm of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar make a Perſonal Attribute to be predicated as an Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial one, and an Eſſential Attribute to be predicated in the nature of a Perſonal Attribute?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is the very Queſtion, Why two Phraſes in Senſe, and according to all the Rules of Logick equipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſhould be ſo differently interpreted merely from a Criticiſm of Grammar, that the one of them ſhould be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the other Heretical?</p>
               <p>It's alſo manifeſt from theſe Inſtances, that the ſecond Rule of an Abſolute and Relative Predicate is falſe. <hi>Deus, Dominus, Creator, Spirator,</hi> are manifeſtly Relative Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes: There can be no diſpute of the three laſt; and the

Scripture Expreſſions of <hi>my God, thy God, our God, your God,</hi> prove the Relativeneſs of this term <hi>God.</hi> Beſides, that an abſolute Attribute put into an Adjective Form, may, as I have ſhewed, be plurally predicated.</p>
               <p>Nay, if it were unlawful to predicate plurally an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Eſſential Attribute, the Whole Church has hitherto erred, which has never ſcrupled the Phraſe of Three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Holy, Omnipotent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Perſons; or in the Phraſe of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed, (which all the Schoolmen eſteemed to be genuine) Three Co-eternal Perſons.</p>
               <p>The Schoolmen indeed were infinitely perplexed how to reconcile the Author of that Creed to himſelf; that it was lawful to ſay, Three Co-eternal Perſons, and yet at the ſame time forbidden to ſay, <hi>Three Eternals</hi> in the Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Gender. Here <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> their Leader, help'd them at a dead lift; and when he could not bring the Rule [concerning the Diſtinction of Nouns Subſtantive and Nouns Adjective] to this Creed; he brought the Creed to the Rule: And as <hi>Petavius</hi> ſomewhere obſerves, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all Rules of Grammar, he interpreted all thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Phraſes Subſtantively, that is, he taught that they ought to have been put into the Neuter Gender; it ought to have been <hi>non tria oeterna ſed unum oeternum,</hi> &amp;c. which Conſtruction the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed will very well bear in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation.</p>
               <p>But I muſt here acknowledge to my Reader, that this Diſtinction of an abſolute and relative Predicate, as the adaequate Reaſon of a Plural or Singular Predication in this Sacred Myſtery, is much Ancienter than the Schoolmen, claims the Authority of the <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers, who all received it from St. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi>

                  </note>I will give it in St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s own words, <q rend="margQuotes">[Quicquid de Deo dicitur vel intelligitur, non ſecundum accidens, ſed ſecundum ſubſtantiam dicitur Quapropter ingenitum Patri ſecundum ſubſtantiam eſt, &amp; genitum eſſe Filio ſecundum ſubſtantiam eſt: diverſum eſt autem ingenitum &amp; genitum, diverſa eſt ergo ſubſtantia Patris &amp; Filii.]</q> To this ſenſe, All the Predicates concerning God or the Divine Perſons, are either ſubſtantial or accidental Predications. Not the latter, becauſe nothing is mutable in God; if the former, then to be unbegotten is a ſubſtantial Predicate of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to be begotten is a ſubſtantial Predicate of the Son: But to be unbegotten, and to be begotten, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to the other; therefore the ſubſtance of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son are diverſe or different.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſeems not to acknowledge an accidental Predication concerning God; and it is confeſſed, that to be unbegotten, or to be begotten, are neceſſary, and not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Predications of the Father and Son.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> anſwers to the Objection, That there was a middle Predication betwixt theſe two, ſubſtantial and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, which was a relative Predication.</p>
               <p>Now it is very true, that there is a middle Predication betwixt theſe two, an eſſential Predication, and an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal one. Secondly, it is as true, that in the Objection of the <hi>Arian,</hi> this middle Predication was a relative Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But, with all ſubmiſſion, it was <hi>error non cauſoe pro causâ,</hi> to aſſign the relativeneſs of the Predication, as the reaſon of its being a middle Predication.</p>
               <p>The Objection is a plain Sophiſm, equivocating in the phraſe <hi>Subſtantia,</hi> which has a double ſenſe in this Myſtery; ſometimes it ſignifies the ſame with Perſon or <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:66343:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſometimes the ſame with Eſſence: in the former ſenſe, the Concluſion is ſound and orthodox, that the Subſtance, that is, <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of the Father and Son is different.</p>
               <p>And the Solution of this Objection is plain and eaſy; A perſonal Predication is a middle Predication, betwixt an eſſential and an accidental Predication, and that a perſonal Predication may be as neceſſary as an eſſential one amongſt humane perſons; the difference of Sex is a perſonal, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Predication. Amongſt the Divine Perſons, to be unbegotten, to be begotten, to proceed, diſtinguiſh the Perſons, but divide not the Eſſence. Paternity is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Perſon of the Father, but not eſſential to Him; for then Paternity would be common to the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> could not have failed of this true Anſwer, had he read the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, and from them learned the true Diſtinction of <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> and <hi>

                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> What Rule can I my ſelf give concerning the plural or ſingular Predication of any Attribute concerning the Divine Perſons?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That all plural Predications are either equipollent with, or reducible to this one allowed Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That there are Three Divine Perſons.</hi> This is plain, and needs neither Illuſtration nor Proof.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Is not this the ſame Diſtinction of an eſſential and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Predicate, which I have before declared inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That ſo indeed the Schoolmen expound it. To them this fundamental Article of Natural Religion, there is but One God, is the ſame with this, that there is but One Divine Eſſence. But I conceive that theſe are diſtinct Articles.</p>

               <p>It is ominous to ſtumble at the Threſhold; theſe two Terms <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Godhead,</hi> are formally diſtinct, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be Confounded. Every thing which may be affirmed of one of theſe Terms, cannot with equal Truth and Propriety be always affirmed of the other. The Chriſtian Religion has taught us, That there are Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Godhead; or, in the words of the firſt Article of our Church, in the Unity of the Godhead: For the Unity of the Godhead, and the Unity of the Trinity are equipollent Articles, and there are certainly Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Trinity, in the Unity of the Trinity.</p>
               <p>But if we take this term God, as diſtinct from God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, we can by no means ſay, That there are three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in God, or in one God: The Chriſtian Religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels us to acknowledge, that each diſtinct Perſon is God; which would be impoſſible, if there were three Perſons in God. For how can that Perſon be God, which wants ſomething which is in God; for each diſtinct Perſon has not three Perſons in him. Hence the 11th Council of Toledo; <hi>[Nec rectè dici poteſt, ut in uno Deo ſit Trinitas]</hi> with the Animadvertor's leave, the Heretick <hi>Sabellius,</hi> and not the Chriſtian Religion taught this Article, that there are three Perſons in one God.</p>

               <p>Secondly, This is the great Objection of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> three Humane Perſons are three Men, three Angelical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons three Angels, therefore three Divine Perſons three Gods. They eſteem God and a Divine Perſon terms equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent and convertible, they eſteem the Conſequence from three Divine Perſons to three Gods neceſſary, immediate, and unavoidable. Not one <hi>Socinian</hi> who underſtands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but will confeſs that he can as ſoon believe three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Minds as three Divine Perſons reconcileable with the Article of the Unity of God.</p>
               <p>If the Animadvertor can give an Anſwer to this <hi>Socinian</hi> Objection from the Phraſe of three Divine Perſons, which is not equally applicable to his own Objection againſt the Phraſe of three Infinite Spirits, I will yield him the Point he contends for.</p>
               <p>[One thing I muſt note, which to me betrays the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvertor's fear, I mean his not repreſenting the Objection fair. The Dean's Phraſe is put down three diſtinct Infinite Minds, why did he not equally ſay, three diſtinct Infinite Perſons? Why muſt this laſt be expreſſed by a Circumlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, three Perſons, of which every one is Infinite? How often has the Animadvertor uſed the Phraſe of three Divine Perſons, which is the ſame with three Infinite Perſons? Is not this to make a diſtinction without a difference?]</p>

ſo ſtand diſtinguiſhed from one another by their whole Beings or Natures: But the Divine Perſons are three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives (or one ſimple Being or Eſſence under three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Relations) and conſequently differ from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not wholly and by all that is in them, but only by ſome certain Mode or Reſpect peculiar to each, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account cauſing their diſtinction.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Anſwer puts me in mind of a certain Reſpondent, who being at a great loſs, cryed, <hi>Nego id,</hi> not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whether it was the <hi>Major, Minor,</hi> or Concluſion, which he denyed. And I believe moſt Readers will be equally at a loſs, whether the Animadvertor applies this Anſwer to the Premiſes or Concluſion.</p>
               <p>The Animadvertor's Argument againſt the Reverend Dean's Aſſertion of three Infinite Minds is this: One Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mind is one God, therefore three Infinite Minds are three Gods. The <hi>Socinians</hi> Objection <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi> the ſame, One Divine Perſon is one God, therefore three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons are three Gods. The Conſequence of each Argument the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> That three Infinite Minds, three Divine Perſons muſt be thrice what one Infinite Mind, or one Divine Perſon is.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence is a Mathematical Concluſion, that three of any kind muſt be thrice what one of the ſame kind is.</p>
               <p>Will the Animadvertor deny the Antecedent, that one Divine Perſon is one God? Or will he deny that Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are three Perſons?</p>
               <p>This Objection depends not immediately upon the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs or Abſoluteneſs of a Divine Perſon: If one Mode, one Accident, one Relation be one God, how ſhall we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Concluſion, that three Modes, three Accidents, or three Relations are three Gods?</p>
               <p>The force of this Anſwer, if it has any, muſt lye in this, that there are not properly three Divine Perſons: the Divine
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66343:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Perſons are not three, as three Infinite Minds are three: to ſpeak the truth, the ternary number belongs not to the Perſons, but to the Perſonalities, to the Modes, to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. We uſe the Phraſe of <hi>three Relatives,</hi> but we mean only three relations of one ſimple Being; and with equal Juſtice, the Animadvertor might have ſaid, that we uſe the Phraſe of three Perſons, but we mean only three Perſonalities of one abſolute Perſon.</p>
               <p>The Animadvertor entirely begs the Queſtion, if he takes three Relatives and one ſimple Being under three Relations to be equipollent. <hi>Adam</hi> had three relations, of a Creature, an Husband, and a Father, yet he is but one Relative. A Relative is not the Relation, but that which has the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Subject of the Relation. The Perſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is one ſimple Being, God, under two Relations (of Generation and Spiration) is therefore the Perſon of the Father two Relatives, two Perſons?</p>
               <p>Again, the Divine Perſons are three Relatives. Why did not the Animadvertor ſpeak out? Are they three Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Subſtances, three Relative Accidents, or three Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Modes?</p>
               <p>Further <hi>Genebrard</hi> (and the ſame I believe of the Reverend Dean) would have told him, that three Infinite Minds or Spirits have but one ſingular, individual, Spiritual Nature or Eſſence, and therefore, according to <hi>Genebrard,</hi> three Infinite Minds differ no more than three Divine Perſons.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the difference of the Divine Perſons is not the difference of one ſimple Being under three Relations: For one ſimple Being under one Relation cannot be ſimply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed of it ſelf under another Relation. <hi>Adam</hi> the Father is <hi>Adam</hi> the Husband, <hi>Adam</hi> the Creature: the Perſon of the Father is the Spirator of the Holy Ghoſt, though as he is one, he is not the other; this latter is a Modal, not ſimple Negation. But the Animadvertor himſelf tells us, <hi>That whereſoever there are Two diſtinct Perſons, we do and

                  <hi>that one of them is (ſimply) not the other:</hi> Which ſingle paſſage, overthrows our Animadvertor's Hypotheſis, that the Divine Perſons differ by a Modal difference.

This will make ſtrange Divinity, if we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to the Father, Son or Holy Ghoſt.

If the Animadvertor does not already know it, let me inform him, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith is, That every ſingle Divine Perſon is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially (quidditative, as the Schools ſpeak) a Spirit, or God:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66343:49"/>
as fully as every ſingle Angelical perſon is eſſentially a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or an Angel.

               <p>Firſt it is unintelligible cant, a ſingular nature or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in conjunction with the Mode, or a ſingular nature ſuſtaining a Mode is uſual: but to put the cart before the Horſes, to put the Mode before the Nature, the Adjunct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Subject is new Philoſophy peculiar to the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor.</p>
               <p>Secondly.

               <p>A Mode of Subſiſtence in the ſenſe of the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for a Subſiſtential form or Perſonality is improperly ſaid to be ſuſtained. Perſonality is the conſtituent form of the Perſon, and not an adjunct of the Perſon.</p>
               <p>Again, Nature when diſtinguiſhed from the Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum or Perſon, is not the Subject of the Relations or Modes: The Suppoſitum or Perſon is the proper Subject of the Relations or Modes ſuſtained by that Perſon.</p>
               <p>Further, The common Aſſertion of the Schools is not barely, that the Divine Nature ſuſtains three diſtinct Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or three diſtinct Modes; but that it ſuſtains three Relations of the ſame kind, three diſtinct Perſonalities, which is the great difficulty. One and the ſame Perſon may be twice a Father, if he has Two Children, that is Natural: But can we conceive, that a Man can be twice a Father of one and the ſame Son. This is the queſtion, how, according to the Schools, one and the ſame ſingular Nature, when it is become one Perſon in the Father, by one ſubſiſtential form, can receive a diſtinct ſubſiſtential form without loſing the firſt, and alſo a third, without loſing the firſt or ſecond. I freely acknowledge, that this is to me an inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difficulty; and therefore, I bleſs God, that to me, the Faith of Three Divine Perſons, needs not ſo nice a ſpeculation.</p>

               <p>The whole Truth was not revealed to the Jewiſh Church, or at leaſt ſo very obſcurely, that very few of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it. But yet I verily believe, that what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, was a moſt Sacred truth.</p>
               <p>I believe, that the God, whom the Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers by the Light of Nature worſhipped, was one Divine Perſon.

               <p>In this the Animadvertor enquires into the Hiſtorical truth of this Aſſertion, whether the Ancients believed the Divine Perſons to be Intelligent Minds or Beings. This the Reverend Dean thought an unconteſted Article to all who profeſſed the Faith of a Trinity of Divine Perſons. The Reverend Dean was of the learned <hi>Genebrard</hi>'s Opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quoted, <hi>viz.</hi> That this was <hi>Propoſitio vera ac fide ab Eccleſia Catholica omnibus temporibus recepta;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as it is uſual in unconteſted Articles, was leſs curious in Collecting the Proofs of an undiſputed Opinion; which yet I ſpeak not, as if I thought the Proofs of this Aſſertion brought by the Reverend Dean inſufficient.</p>
               <p>One thing however I can by no means omit, that the Animadvertor has disjoynted the faireſt Proof of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Opinion in this Debate, and treated of it in his next Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> That Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt were eſteemed ſo certainly to be three Infinite Minds by the Ancients, that they aſſerted Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt to be one by a Specifick Unity.</p>
               <p>Now, though I ſhould grant to the Animadvertor, that the Fathers did not underſtand ſuch Aſſertions in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe of ſuch Phraſes, but only by way of Reſemblance (of which afterwards) yet this muſt be allowed, that the Ancient Fathers could have had no ſhadow or pretence for ſuch an Aſſertion, unleſs they had believed Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt to be three Intelligent Beings, which is but another Phraſe for three Intelligent Minds.</p>

               <p>It is the Faith and has been the Language of the Church before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, that <hi>Deus est Trinus in Perſonis,</hi> that God is Three in Perſons.</p>
               <p>And this is the juſt and eaſie Anſwer to that (dreadful) Objection of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that three Divine Perſons infer three Gods, as three Angelical Perſons infer three Angels, <hi>viz.</hi> That if by three Gods the <hi>Socinians</hi> mean that there

               <p>Ask a <hi>Socinian,</hi> what he means by God, in that Phraſe of three Gods?

               </p>
               <p>Juſt ſo does the Animadvertor deal with the Reverend Dean: He declares, that he takes God and Infinite Mind to be equipollent; and I will aſſure him, that none will deny that three Infinite Minds are three Infinite Minds. And ſo the Reverend Dean is eternally confuted, or rather the Animadvertor ought to be aſhamed of ſo weak a Sophiſm.</p>
               <p>If the Animadvertor, or any <hi>Socinian</hi> will deal like a Scholar, and not like a Sophiſter, let either of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe Arguments which deny a Plurality of Gods, and ſhew that they are equally ſtrong againſt the Faith of three Infinite Minds or three Divine Perſons, and they ſhall not fail of an Anſwer by God's aſſiſtance, as ſoon as I can finiſh it; but this more properly belongs to my Second Part.</p>
               <p>It is a meer begging of the Queſtion to ſay, that this term God is not capable of Multiplication, when it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies equipollently with a Divine Perſon, or any other equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Phraſe, as an Infinite Mind or the like.</p>

               <p>The Animadvertor, [<hi>p.</hi> 156. <hi>lin.</hi> 9.] had declared it to be <hi>very true,</hi> that <hi>the Son is a begotten Mind and Wiſdom;</hi> and in the ſame place denies, <q rend="margQuotes">That the Eternal Mind or Wiſdom begetting, and the Eternal Mind or Wiſdom

               </p>
               <p>In this place the Animadvertor advances one ſtep higher, and tells us, that unbegotten Wiſdom and begotten Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are not two Wiſdoms, but <hi>only one Wiſdom under two ſeveral Modifications;</hi> as alſo that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are <hi>one Infinite Spirit under three diſtinct Modali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, ſay I, if this be a fair Solution of this difficulty, it is impoſſible for the wiſeſt Perſon to be certain that he can count two.</p>
               <p>For ought any one then can tell, the Reverend Dean and the Animadvertor may not be two Perſons, but only one Perſon under two Modifications.</p>
               <p>The higheſt Proof that can be brought in ſuch Enquiry, is, that Contradictions may be verified concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Dean and the Animadvertor, that what the one is, the other is not. Now there cannot be a plainer, fuller Contradiction than to be begotten, and to be unbegotten.</p>
               <p>Again, this Anſwer undermines the Faith of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chuch, the Faith of three Divine Perſons. The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellianiſt</hi> aſſerts that Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are not three Perſons, but one Perſon under three diſtinct Moda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; which Modifications diverſifie and diſtinguiſh the Perſon they belong to, but not multiply him. The ſame Perſon is both the Father and the Son, but as he is one, he is not the other. Now the allowed Proof of a Plurality of Divine Perſons is from the contradictory Predicates, which may be verified of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in the words of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed; <q rend="margQuotes">The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten; the Son is of the Father alone, not made, not created, but begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.

               <p>The Moderns, who follow the Schoolmen, ſay indeed the ſame thing with the Animadvertor, that it is one and the ſame ſingular Wiſdom which is both unbegotten and begotten; that is, one Wiſdom under two diſtinct Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications: But then they underſtand themſelves better, than to ſay, <hi>That it is very true, that the Son is a begotten Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> They ſay, that Begotten Wiſdom is to be underſtood in an improper ſenſe, and conſequently that the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is only in words, and not in reality.</p>
               <p>According to the Schoolmen, the Son is unbegotten Wiſdom. The Wiſdom of the Son is equally unbegotten with the Wiſdom of the Father, and that Propoſition, the Son is begotten Wiſdom, is only true according to them, <hi>ſenſu reduplicativo, viz.</hi> That the Son who is begotten, is alſo Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Now certainly unbegotten is a very improper ſenſe of being begotten.</p>
               <p>The Phraſe of <hi>Begotten Wiſdom</hi> was uſed without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the Ancients, and though <hi>Lombard</hi> and the bold <hi>Lateran</hi> Council condemned this Phraſe Hand over Head, yet the more Prudent Perſons of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church thought it more elegible to allow the Phraſe in complyance with Antiquity, and ſtrive to evade it by a ſtretched Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by a <hi>ſenſus reduplicativus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Animadvertor has here borrowed the words of the Shoolmen, but without underſtanding their meaning.</p>
               <p>Nay, it is very obſervable that the Animadvertor, who here in <hi>p.</hi> 156. tells us, That it is <hi>very true, that there is a begotten Mind or Wiſdom,</hi> is of a quite different Opinion, <hi>p.</hi> 159. <hi>lin.</hi> 18. <hi>viz.</hi> That this cannot be ſaid <hi>in Truth and Propriety of ſpeech: For God cannot properly be ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>The <hi>Sabellian</hi> Hereticks have adulterated the Divine Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, becauſe they could not explain how God, an Immortal Spirit, can generate.</p>
               <p>On the other Hand, the Schoolmen are not ſatisfied, that the Articles of the Trinity and Incarnation in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral contain great Myſteries in them, but they will have every Concluſion throughout both the Articles to be ſo.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Articles are delivered with ſo much plainneſs and ſimplicity in the Sacred Scriptures, and with ſo much ſubtilty in the Writings of the Schoolmen, that a ſtranger to the Chriſtian Faith upon the comparing of them both together, could hardly be perſwaded, that the latter were pretended to be an explication of the former.</p>
               <p>The Sacred Writings contented themſelves to teach us that the Father and Son are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>one,</hi> that theſe three are <hi>one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fathers of the Church juſtly explained this Unity, that they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one in Nature, one in Godhead; the Unity of a Father and a begotten Son is an Unity of Nature.</p>
               <p>The Shoolmen advance one ſtep higher; it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient with them, for any one to acknowledge the Divine

Perſons to be one in Nature, Eſſence, Divinity, unleſs, he adds, in one <hi>ſingular</hi> Eſſence, in one <hi>ſingular</hi> Nature, in one <hi>ſingular</hi> Divinity, and that under pain of being guilty of the worſt of Hereſies, Tritheiſm it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Animadvertor keeps pace with the warmeſt, not only contends againſt the admiſſion of a Specifick Unity in the Trinity, but calls it a Traducing of the Fathers to aſſert that they held this Specifick Unity.</p>
               <p>As to the Queſtion it ſelf, I wiſh from the bottom of my Heart, that we might learn to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Primary Concluſions of our Faith and diſputed Articles; that they who contend for the ſingularity of the common Divine Nature with the Schools, would not overthrow the received Faith of three Divine Perſons; and that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Unity of God be eſteemed infinitely more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred than any ſeeming Advantages that the Aſſertion of a Specifick Unity of the Trinity might afford us in the maintaining the Faith of three Divine Perſons.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Faith profeſſes an Unity in Trinity, and a Trinity in Unity: He therefore who aſſerts an Unity to deſtroy the Trinity, or a Trinity in derogation of the Unity, offends againſt the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall much rather chooſe my ſelf, and recommend to my Orthodox Reader the Belief, that the Divine Nature is above theſe terms of Art, above theſe diſtinctions of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick of Singular and Univerſal, that it is tranſcendental to thoſe Rules, by which we judge of created inferiour Natures; than any ways weaken either of thoſe Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Articles before mentioned, either of the Unity of God, or of the Trinity of Divine Perſons.</p>

               <p>I have the ſame Plea in reference to my Second Part, my Expoſition of the Article of the Unity of God, that it is of the Ancient Fathers; they are both Venerable for their grey Hairs.</p>
               <p>All I pretend to, is only my weak Endeavour to ſet theſe two Ancient Expoſitions of the Articles of the Unity of God and the Trinity in a fairer Light, to prove that they are very conſiſtent one with another, and liable to no juſt Exception by a <hi>Socinian.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is the Firſt Part, whether the Ancient Fathers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted a Specifical Sameneſs, Unity, Identity of Nature, or a Numerical Unity, or rather a Singularity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</p>
               <p>The Dean quotes two very learned Perſons, <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> and tells us, that they have proved the Specifical Unity of Nature to be the Opinion of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Fathers; nay, that they have abundantly proved it.</p>
               <p>Had two ſuch able Judges of Antiquity barely ſaid it, it would have weighed very much with conſidering Perſons: But the Dean tells us, that they have not barely ſaid it, but proved it, abundantly proved it, which cannot be otherwiſe underſtood, than that they have quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeveral Sayings of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, which plainly and undeniably evince, abundantly prove this to have been their Judgment.</p>
               <p>This was very full to the Dean's Deſign to prove that three Divine Perſons are three Infinite Minds; that is, that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers judged them ſo. For I dare ſay,<note place="margin">p. 215. l. 10.</note> that no Man beſides himſelf will deny, <hi>That three diſtinct Infinite Minds or Spirits are Specifically one,</hi> if not by an higher degree of Unity. No one who underſtands the meaning of the terms, can deny that this term <hi>Infinite Mind</hi> is predicated of three Infinite Minds, as a <hi>Species</hi> is predicated of its Individuals. No one ſurely will ſay, that three Infinite Minds differ <hi>Specie</hi> or in their definition. If three Finite Minds are Specifically one, are one <hi>in Specie,</hi> ſuch an Unity (or an higher) cannot be denyed to three Infinite Minds. Again, according to his own Argument, a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66343:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Specifick Unity implies a multiplication of the Nature. And ſince all acknowledge that each Divine Perſon is an Infinite Mind, if their Unity be only a Specifick Unity, according to the Animadvertor they are three Infinite Minds in the higheſt ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The Animadvertor charges the Phraſe of three Infinite Minds with the groſſeſt Tritheiſm <hi>(it immediately and unavoidably infers three Gods.)</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Preface, <hi>pag.</hi> II.</note> The Reverend Dean pleads the Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, that they had ſaid as much, nay, more than he; they had aſſerted a Specifick Unity of the Trinity, which in the Animadvertor's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment implies a multiplication of the Divine Nature; that is, three Infinite Spiritual Natures; whereas three Infinite Spirits in the bare Phraſe implies no more than that there are three poſſeſſing one Infinite Spiritual Nature.</p>
               <p>Now I preſume, if the Dean, or rather if <hi>Petavius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> were not miſtaken, the Animadvertor will abate ſomething of his Confidence, he will hardly have brow enough to ſay, That the Notion of the Trinity, which the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers advanced, <hi>was a ſilly, Heretical Notion, immediately and unavoidably inferring three Gods.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers Judgment is not indeed the Rule of our Faith; but it deſervedly demands a Veneration from all Modeſt and Pious Chriſtians, and is infinitely to be preferred before the bare Authority of the Schoolmen or Moderns.</p>

               <p>If the Animadvertor is unfit to take two ſuch learned Perſons to task, why does he contradict their Judgment?

The Fathers never believed indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, univerſally the ſame Unity betwixt Humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as betwixt the Divine Perſons, nor is that the Queſtion; but whether they believed the ſame Unity of Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the latter as is confeſſedly betwixt the former. A Specifick Unity of the Divine Nature (if we for once only ſuppoſe ſuch an Unity) has quite different Conſequences from what a Specifick Unity of a created Humane Nature implies, which yet alters not the Unity of each Nature.</p>
               <p>Well, but the Animadvertor has compared the Dean and <hi>Petavius.</hi> May I ask him, why he did not alſo conſult Dr. <hi>Cudworth?</hi> He gives him a Complement in the foregoing Lines, his Piece is not ſo rare but it might eaſily have been procured. He was a Proteſtant Divine, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great and deſerved Repute for Learning and Skill in Antiquity, and which is more, gives judgment againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: He himſelf embraces the <hi>Platonick</hi> Hypotheſis, which infers a Generical, not Specifical Unity of the Trinity.

               <p>What does the Animadvertor ſay to <hi>Petavius?</hi> Has the Reverend Dean miſrepreſented <hi>Petavius</hi> or not? Why does not the Animadvertor ſpeak plain?

               <p>Had the Animadvertor conſulted the ſeventh and ninth Chapters of this fourth Book of <hi>Petavius</hi> concerning the Trinity, he could neither have doubted of <hi>Petavius</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor well of that of the Ancient Fathers.</p>
               <p>Well, the Animadvertor has a Refuge for himſelf, if <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius</hi> has given his Judgment againſt him, in the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate following words.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I muſt put this into form, and then the weakneſs of it will evidently appear. The Argument of the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor is to this purpoſe, If the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers held and acknowledged one Numerical God and no more, then they held only a Numerical Unity of the Divine Nature; and if they held only a Numerical Unity of the Divine Nature in the Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity, then they could not hold a Specifick Unity of the Divine Nature in the Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:66343:63"/>But the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, and thoſe after them, held and acknowledged one Numerical God and no more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, A Numerical Unity of God, infers a Numerical Unity of Nature in the Divine Perſons; and a Numerical Unity of Nature in the Divine Perſons, is inconſiſtent with a Specifick Unity of the Divine Nature in the Divine Perſons.</p>
               <p>Now grant this laſt to be true in the Animadvertor's Senſe, what follows, That the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers who held the Antecedent, muſt alſo hold the Conſequent: By no means. This indeed follows, that they ought to have held the Conſequent, if they embraced the Antecedent; not that they actually did.</p>
               <p>It is a very weak Argument, that ſuch Perſons embrace ſuch a Concluſion, becauſe they hold ſuch Premiſes, from whence another believes, that ſuch a Concluſion does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I muſt examine his Antecedent: The <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers held and acknowledged one Numerical God and no more. This is ambiguouſly expreſſed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, the whole Catholick Church, holds and acknowledges one God, and in what Senſe God is one, it is impoſſible he ſhould be more: For one and more than one are contradictorily oppoſed, and therefore impoſſible to be verified of the ſame Subject in the ſame Senſe.</p>
               <p>But neither the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, nor the Catholick Church, do ſo hold God to be one, but they alſo hold God to be Three, that is, In a different Senſe of the term God, <hi>viz.</hi> God is Three in Perſons, that is, When this term God is taken as equipollent with a Divine Perſon, for undoubtedly the Catholick Faith is, that there are Three Divine Perſons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews, Socinians, Mahometans,</hi> do indeed hold, that there is but one Numerical God, but one in Perſon; that there is but one Divine Perſon; but the Chriſtian Faith is, that <hi>Deus eſt unus &amp; Trinus.</hi>

                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:66343:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>Again, The Numerical Unity of God does not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the <hi>Modus</hi> of the Unity of the Trinity, does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that there is a Trinity of Divine Perſons, and much leſs of what kind their Unity is.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is a miſtake, though a common one, that a Numerical Unity of the common Divine Eſſence, and a Specifick Unity of the ſame Eſſence are inconſiſtent: A common Eſſence muſt of neceſſity be Numerically One, even in Three Humane Perſons, the Common Humanity, the <hi>Species</hi> of Humanity is numerically One; there is as ſtrictly one <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Adam, Eve</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> as there is one Perſon of <hi>Adam.</hi> The Moderns indeed ſay, that there are three ſingular Humane Natures of <hi>Adam, Eve</hi> and <hi>Seth;</hi> but it is a Contradiction to ſay, that the ſingular Nature of <hi>Adam</hi> is common to <hi>Eve.</hi> It is the Objection of the Animadvertor, that a Specifick Unity in the Trinity, would imply three ſingular Divine Natures in the three Perſons, of which afterwards: But be that ſo, ſtill the common Divine Eſſence would be numerically One, that is, the Species of the Divinity would be but one; or which is the ſame, the common Divine Nature would be an Univerſal.</p>

               <p>The Animadvertor's next refuge is,<note place="margin">n. 5. p. 175. lin. 5.</note> only his own poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> that the Fathers <hi>always</hi> [mark that word, <hi>always</hi>] alledged the Example of three or more individual Men agreeing in the ſame Nature, either by way of Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Illuſtration, as it is the neareſt reſemblance of, and approach to this Divine Unity, of any that could be found in created Beings; or elſe <hi>à minore ad majus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I reply, Firſt, that theſe two ways are really but one way; what is only a near reſemblance, muſt in this debate be <hi>à minore ad majus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Animadvertor's Phraſe is univerſal, they <hi>always</hi> alledged it thus, which ſuppoſes, that not one ſingle Father, in any one ſingle paſſage, ever alledged it otherways; and that the Animadvertor has examined every ſingle paſſage, and upon his own Experience finds it ſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Unity of three Humane Perſons, of three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct proper Beings, of three Subſtances, of three Natures, can never be the neareſt reſemblance of, and approach to, the Unity of one ſimple Subſtance or Being under three Relations.

There are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Inſtances in Nature, of one ſimple Being under theſe Relations, the ſingle Perſon of <hi>Adam</hi> has three Relations.</p>

                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:66343:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>The Animadvertor (p. 167.) calls it <hi>a jocular Argument,</hi> an Argument fit to be anſwered by Laughter only, to argue from three Humane Perſons, from <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, to the three Divine Perſons, yet here to ſerve a turn, he acknowledges it to be the neareſt reſemblance of, and approach to, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Unity, that can be found in created Beings.

               <p>Fourthly, This is ſo far from being an Argument, <hi>à minore ad majus,</hi> upon the Animadvertor's Principles, that it is juſtly eſteemed by all the Moderns who follow the Schools, one of the difficulteſt Objections againſt the Faith of the Trinity, <hi>viz.</hi> that if three Humane Perſons have three ſingular Humane Natures, and conſequently are ſo many Men; why three Divine Perſons ſhould not alſo infer three ſingular Divine Natures, and conſequently be three Gods.

               <p>This is ſufficient <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> to the Animadvertor; but for my Reader's fuller Satisfaction, I anſwer to the Point, that ſo far as this Allegation is true, 'tis Impertinent, and that ſo far as 'tis pertinent 'tis falſe.</p>
               <p>'Tis an acknowledged Truth, that the ſtricteſt Union that can be betwixt Humane Perſons, is but a reſemblance, an Alluſion to that inſeparable, incomprehenſible Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Divine Perſons. But this is not the queſtion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Union of the Divine Perſons indefinitely, but concerning the Unity of their Nature: The Fathers main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that the Unity of the common Divine Nature was of the ſame kind and degree with the Unity of the common Humane Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:66343:66"/>There is certainly a greater Union betwixt two Humane Perſons who are dear and intimate Friends, than betwixt two who are mortal Enemies: There is a greater Union betwixt two Saints in Heaven, than betwixt the beſt Friends on Earth: And yet two mortal Enemies have the ſame Unity of Nature with the Saints in Heaven.</p>
               <p>The Union of the Saints in Heaven, is by our Saviour himſelf reſembled to the Union of the Father and the Son, <hi>John</hi> 17.22. <hi>That they may be one, as we are one.</hi> But theſe words no more denote an illimited equality, than thoſe other words of our Lord, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Father in Heaven is perfect,</hi> denote an equality in Perfection.</p>
               <p>If we ſuppoſe three unbegotten, unproduced Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, three Fathers, I cannot ſee how we can deny ſuch to be Conſubſtantial, ſince we acknowledge three Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Perſons to be of one Nature and Subſtance; yet three unbegotten Divine Perſons, three Fathers are to all the Ancient Fathers, three Gods. They did not therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a Specifick Unity was the only Unity of the Divine Perſons, that they were one upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but if we can know their meaning by their words, they did certainly believe a Specifick Unity: And this I perſwade my ſelf the Animadvertor's Heart miſgave him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">n. 7.</note>He therefore comes in with a third Salvo, p. 176. <q rend="margQuotes">[That he does not in the leaſt deny, but ſeveral Expreſſions may have dropped from the Fathers, which if we looked no further, might be drawn to a very inconvenient Senſe.]</q> That is, in plain Engliſh, ſeveral Expreſſions have dropped from them, which aſſert (if we look no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) a Specifick Unity. What from thoſe Fathers who <hi>never</hi> alledged this Example as a parallel Inſtance, but <hi>always</hi> uſed it by way of Alluſion, or <hi>à minore ad majus?</hi> It ſeems the Animadvertor's <hi>always</hi> and <hi>never</hi> will bear
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66343:66"/>
an exception. What Salvoe has he for this? He gives it us in the following words, <q rend="margQuotes">[But then alſo it is as little to be deny'd, that the ſame Fathers profeſſedly and deſignedly treating of the ſame Points here, declared themſelves in ſuch terms, as are very hardly, if at all reconcileable to thoſe occaſional and accidental Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. And therefore, ſince their meaning cannot be taken from both, it ought much rather to be taken from what was aſſerted by them deſignedly, than what was aſſerted only occaſionally.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is well contrived to take the concluſion for granted, he is to prove. It ſeems that the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>would have things come to that paſs, that we must take his bare affirmation of a thing for a proof of it. Petavius,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> the Reverend Dean of St. <hi>Paul's,</hi> have aſſerted the quite contrary, they have already equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently denied it, and the Animadvertor gives us his own <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> that it is little to be denied.</p>
               <p>Again, the Animadvertor pretends no more than a difficulty, or a doubt, whether theſe deſigned expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may not be reconciled to the occaſional expreſſions. The Animadvertor makes an if of it, to him, theſe latter are hardly, if at all, reconcileable with the former; which is no great wonder, ſince he believes <hi>tribus ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiis conſubſtantialibus</hi> to be neither truth nor ſenſe, ſince he believes a numerical Unity abſolutely inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with a Specifick Unity.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Why is the concluſion ſtronger than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes? Why does he make the concluſion poſitive? <hi>Their meaning cannot be taken from both,</hi> is the concluſion; whereas the premiſes mentioned only a difficulty, or a doubt. <hi>They are hardly, if at all, reconcileable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Animadvertor was, I believe,<note place="margin">n. 8.</note> in ſome meaſure ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the weakneſs of theſe anſwers; and therefore,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66343:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He provides a fourth Salvoe,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 176.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q rend="margQuotes">that the Orthodox Writers of the fourth and part of the fifth Century, were chiefly exerciſed with the <hi>Arian</hi> Controverſie. And the <hi>Arians</hi> would not allow ſo much as a ſpecifick Unity of Nature between the Father and the Son, but inſtead of an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or ſameneſs, held only an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Nature between them, but therefore we have the leſs cauſe to wonder, if there be defects in ſome of their Arguments; if ſome of their reaſonings about the <hi>Trinity,</hi> ſeem to look no further than a ſpecifick Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nature in the Divine Perſons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is as little to the advantage of the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's cauſe, as the former allegations.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arians</hi> would not allow ſo much as a ſpecifick Unity between the Father and the Son,<note place="margin">Nicepho. Calliſt. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. Hiſ. lib. 18. cap. 47.</note> I would fain know what Hereticks ever did allow it: <hi>Nicephorus Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> charges indeed this Opinion upon <hi>Philoponus</hi> and his followers, who are commonly called the Tritheit Hereticks; but he is a later and fabulous Writer, wrote in the fourteenth Century, long after the prevailing of the School-Divinity: <hi>Philoponus</hi> and his followers the Tritheit Hereticks of the ſeventh Century inclined near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Sabellianiſm, than to a belief of a ſpecifick Unity of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> that hard name of Tritheit Hereticks was given them by reaſon of ſome uncouth Phraſes which they uſed, of which hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what conſequence will the Animadvertor draw from the <hi>Arians</hi> not allowing a ſpecifick Unity between the Father and the Son? This is what he aims at, that it ſufficed to maintain a ſpecifick Unity, to confute the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie. I deſire to know why the ſame Plea might not have ſerved the Reverend Dean in his learned Vindication of this Article againſt the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who no more allow a Specifick Unity of the <hi>Trinity</hi> than the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66343:67"/>
                  <hi>Arians</hi> of old. The <hi>Socinians</hi> deny them to be three infinite minds; why will not that Apologize for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Dean? Why is not this molified, and called on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a defect in the Reverend Dean, as the Animadvertor here Stiles it in the Antient Fathers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Arians</hi> objected Tritheiſm againſt the Orthodox Faith, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do to this day: So that had the Ancient Fathers believed this Hereſie a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of aſſerting a ſpecifick Unity in the Trinity, they would as carefully have avoided the aſſerting of it, as the School-men and Moderns do on all occaſions.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The anſwer of the Antients to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Tritheiſm by the <hi>Arians,</hi> is the cleareſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of their judgment; this is the Objection. <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are three Men; therefore, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are three Gods. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral anſwer of the Ancients is by denying the truth of the Antecedent; that <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, abuſively called three Men, that it is contrary to the rules of Philoſophy, to call them otherwiſe than one Man and three Human Perſons, as we ſay in the Bleſſed Trinity, there are three Divine Perſons and one God. Now not one School-man or Modern, as I believe, ever gave ſuch an anſwer. Not one of them ever imagined, that the affirming Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt to be one God, did in the leaſt enforce them to affirm <hi>Peter James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to be one Man. The Animadvertor thinks this Objection only Jocular, only fit to be Laughed at, which the Antients thought ſo weighty, that to get rid of it, they endeavoured, ſays the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> reflectingly, with their Logick, to prove that three Human Perſons ought not to be called three Men. I ſhall conſider their Logicks afterwards, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I declare, that is a manifeſt conviction to me, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:66343:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they did conceive the Unity of Nature between Human and Divine Perſons, parallel equal.</p>

Their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion has never yet been confuted. They were not drawn into this Aſſertion by the heat of Diſputation, or to favour their own Hypotheſis, neither of them approve of a Specifick Unity of the Trinity. The Reverend Dean rightly judged, that thoſe places they had already produced, abundantly proved their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and yet <hi>Petavius</hi> gives them but as an Eſſay, and pronounces this Opinion to be the judgment of <hi>all the Greek Fathers eſpecially.</hi> Shall I ask the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor- a few Queſtions? Was not <hi>Petavius</hi> as capable of judging betwixt occaſional and deſigned Expreſſions as himſelf, as capable of judging betwixt an Alluſion or an Argument <hi>a minore ad majus</hi> as himſelf? Did not <hi>Petavius</hi> know that the <hi>Arians</hi> denyed a Specifick U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Trinity? Shall I ask the Animadvertor, whether he ever conſulted St. <hi>Baſil's</hi> 43d. Epiſtle, and if he did, whether he can have Brow enough to ſay, That that Epiſtle was not deſignedly wrote of the difference of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or whether St. <hi>Baſil</hi> has not in the fulleſt manner, delivered his judgment in this point? I particularly mention this Epiſtle, becauſe our Animadvertor quotes a paſſage out of it, [Pag. 149. of his Animadverſions] under the name of <hi>Greg. Nyſſen de differentia</hi>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:66343:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I do not deſire of the Animadvertor to traverſe and examine all <hi>Petavius</hi>'s Allegations, much leſs all the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers. I am content to ſtand or fall, by this ſingle Epiſtle, if this does not aſſert a Specifick Unity of the Trinity, I am content that it paſs for a Traducing, miſ-repreſenting of the Fathers, to ſay, That any one of them ever held ſuch a Notion.</p>
               <p>And now, I hope, with the leave of the Reader, I may add, that <hi>Petavius,</hi> as well as Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> ſtands as an unanſwered witneſs, and that in the Mouth of theſe two Witneſſes, till better Teſtimony appear, the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Truth of this diſquiſition ſtands at preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">n. 10.</note>I in the ſecond place deſcend to the Problematical part, whether the Reaſons of the Animadvertor are ſo cogent, as to forbid the Admiſſion of a Specifick Unity of the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>The Animadvertor gives us five Reaſons [p. 181. &amp;c.] the three firſt of which are diſpatched in a word.</p>
               <p>His firſt, That if a Numerical Unity, [the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor means a Singularity,] in the ſame Divine Nature, be ſufficent to make the three Perſons one God, then a Specifick Unity of the ſame is not neceſſary. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, thoſe who admit of a Specifick Unity in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſtrictly ſo called, do it upon this account, That they are afraid that a Singularity, a Numerical Unity in the Animadvertors ſenſe, will make Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt one Perſon, as well as one God: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that three, truly three, diſtinct three, can have no other Unity of Nature, ſave a Specifick Unity; and thoſe who admit of both, mean it only in our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conception of things; otherwiſe they believe that the Unity of the Divine Nature is above both theſe terms of Art, that in our imperfect conception, it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66343:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of ſome properties of both theſe Unities, but ſtrictly, and really, it is neither Singular nor Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</p>
               <p>The ſame anſwer ſolves the Animadvertor's ſecond Reaſon,<note place="margin">n. 11.</note> that a greater and leſs degree of Unity are not to be admitted in the Divine Nature: They who admit of a Specifick Unity, deny a Singularity: They who in words admit of both, do not in reality believe two Unities in the Divine Nature, but only one Tranſcendental Unity, in our imperfect Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, partaking of the properties of both theſe Unities.</p>
               <p>His third has been already anſwered,<note place="margin">See cap. 3. n. 5.</note> that a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Unity may agree to ten thouſand Individuals, as well as to three; ſo may one ſimple Being have ten thouſand Relations or Modes, as well as three; this Article is wholly owing to Revelation.</p>
               <p>His fourth is, that a Specifick Unity is principally,<note place="margin">n. 12. p. 182.</note> if not abſolutely notional, and therefore cannot any ways properly belong to the Divine Perſons, nor is by any means neceſſary to make the three Perſons one God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Animadvertor brings in his Concluſion with an if, if not abſolutely notional, and yet argues from that Concluſion, as if it were the moſt allowed Maxim.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Diſtinction of the Divine Attributes, of Juſtice and Mercy, is confeſſedly notional, and yet the Animadvertor formerly pronounces it to be Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, to contradict that Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Unity of Nature betwixt Chriſt and his Mother, is certainly a Specifick Unity, according to the Animadvertor, a notional Unity; and yet it is Hereſie to deny, That Chriſt and his Mother are of one Nature or Conſubſtantial.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:66343:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fourthly, The Relations of likeneſs, equality which are betwixt the Divine Perſons, though founded on the expreſs words of Scripture, <hi>[Chriſt thought it no robbery to be equal with God, the Image of the Inviſible God, the expreſs Image of his Fathers Apoſtaſis]</hi> are by all the School-men confeſs'd to be <hi>relationes rationis,</hi> that is, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional; and yet I hope the Animadvertor will not hence deny, that they ought not properly to belong to the Divine Perſons, nor neceſſary to make them one God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Unity of the Divine Nature, is alſo a Relation, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Conſubſtantial <hi>unius ſubſtantioe,</hi> of one Subſtance, implies a relation in Subſtance: We cannot ſay, That the Father, and the Spirator of the Holy Ghoſt, are Conſubſtantial, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>Sixthly, thoſe Fathers who aſſert a Specifick Unity of the Trinity, do not believe, that the Divine Perſons are ſaid to be one, upon no other account, ſave a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Unity, or that they are deny'd to be three Gods from a Specifick Unity alone; this Unity they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive neceſſary, but not of it ſelf ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Even a Specifick Unity hath a ſufficient <hi>fundamentum in re.</hi> A Specifick Unity is indeed a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Notion, but the Foundation of it is ſomething real, <hi>viz.</hi> a real agreement of the diſtinct Perſons, or individuals in the ſame reaſon of Nature. The Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Ghoſt is God, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as <hi>Peter</hi> is a Man, and <hi>James</hi> is a Man, and <hi>John</hi> is a Man; <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> are not notionally each of them a Man, nor Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, notionally, each of them God. From this real agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:66343:70"/>
in Human Perſons, we Form in Logicks the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Specifick Unity: and the Ancient Fathers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the ſame notion to the agreement of the Divine Perſons.</p>
               <p>The Animadvertor's fifth and laſt Argument is,<note place="margin">n. 13.</note> That a Specifick Unity of Nature implies a Multiplication of the ſaid Nature in every one of the particulars, to which it belongs; therefore, ſuch an Unity cannot be admitted in the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>The Argument put into due Form, is to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>If a Specifick Unity of Nature in Created Perſons or Beings, implies a Multiplication of the ſaid Nature, then a Specifick Unity of Nature in the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, implies a Multiplication of the Divine Nature. But a Specifick Unity of Nature in Created Perſons or Beings, implies a Multiplication of the ſaid Nature; therefore a Specifick Unity of Nature in the Divine Perſons, implies a Multiplication of the Divine Nature. But the Concluſion is Abſurd, the Divine Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncapable of Multiplication, therefore a Specifick Unity in the Divine Nature, is not to be allowed from whence ſuch Concluſion follows.</p>
               <p>Now in this Argument, as it ſtands betwixt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadvertor and my ſelf; I deny the conſequence of the Major, becauſe I am ſatisfied the Animadvertor would do the ſame if I ſhould retort the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi> againſt his own Hypotheſis, as for Inſtance, if I ſhould thus urge.</p>
               <p>If a Singularity of Nature in Created Perſons or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forbids a Plurality of Perſons, or denies a true Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, then a Singularity of the Divine Nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids a Plurality of Divine Perſons, and denies a true
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66343:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Divine Generation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But a Singularity of Nature in Created Perſons or Beings, certainly, confeſſedly forbids a Plurality of Perſons, poſſeſſing the ſame Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Nature, is certainly inconſiſtent with a true Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, therefore a Singularity of the Divine Nature, forbids a Plurality of Divine Perſons, denies a true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son.</p>
               <p>The Animadvertor would quickly tell me that this was a weak Sophiſm, to argue from a conſequence in finite Nature, to the ſame in the Divine Nature: And I deſire to be informed, why I may not make the ſame reply to his Objection from the conſequence of a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Unity in finite Nature.</p>
               <p>Again, I do not poſitively contend for a nice ſtrict Specifick Unity of the Trinity, but for ſuch a Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Unity, which in our imperfect Conception of things, is either a Specifick Unity, or elſe wants a name in our preſent Metaphyſicks.</p>
               <p>I have the ſame Plea of the incomprehenſibleneſs of the Divine Nature, of the Myſteriouſneſs of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Article, which is given by the Moderns to the <hi>Socinian</hi> Objections, againſt the Singularity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Divine Nature.</p>

                  </gap>, that is, three Subjects in which the common Humanity did ſubſiſt, they believed them properly three Hypoſtaſes, which is all the vulgar mean by three Men: The Debate is ſolely about a Phraſe, whether <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are more properly called three Hypoſtaſes in one Human Nature, or three Men. The Former Phraſe, even the Moderns allow, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they confeſs, that all Concrete terms, ſuch as <hi>Man</hi> is, do Primarily ſignifie the Form; and Secondarily aſſignifie the Subject in which ſuch form ſubſiſts; Thirdly, the School-men themſelves give this Rule concerning <hi>Deus, Creator, Dominus,</hi> &amp;c. that becauſe the Form ſignified by thoſe Concrete terms, cannot be Multiplied, [neither <hi>Deitas, vis creatrix,</hi> nor <hi>potentia Dominatrix</hi> are according to the School-men, capable of Multiplication,] therefore, neither are the Concrete terms <hi>Deus, Creator, Dominus,</hi> capable of a Plural Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication. Now by the ſame Rule, this term <hi>Man</hi> ought not to be Plurally Predicated, ſince according to the Philoſophy of the Ancients, Humanity, the Form, was not Multiplied in the ſeveral Human Hypoſtaſes. Nor ſee I, what a School-man can reply upon his own Principles, ſave his own <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> that the Ancients were miſtaken, when they aſſerted that Humanity was not Multiplied in the ſeveral Human Individuals. For my own Part I eſteem this one Reaſon, why
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66343:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thaſe terms, <hi>Deus, Creator, Dominus,</hi> &amp;c. are not Multiplied, but neither the ſole nor chief Reaſon of the Singularity of their Predication; nay further, That the chief Reaſon why the Fathers of the Church from before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, have Religiouſly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a ſingular Predication of thoſe Attributes, is by no means applicable to the term <hi>Man</hi> in reſpect of ſeveral Human Hypoſtaſes; ſo that I can very well comply with common Cuſtom which calls <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> three Men, and yet believe, that Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, ought not to be called three Gods, three Creators, three Lords; but this belongs to my Second Part of the true Notion of the Unity of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">n. 16.</note>A Second thing I ſhall crave leave to obſerve, is, that the School-men themſelves, that is, the chief Leaders of them, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> were not averſe to this Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the Ancients in immaterial Beings, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that the Angelical Nature was not capable of Multiplication in the ſeveral Angelical Perſons, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the ſeveral Angels differed Specifically, and that there could not according to ſome, even by the Omnipotence of God, be created two Angels in the ſame Species.

               </p>
               <p>The Animadverter triumphs over this and ſome other queſtions the Reverend Dean had made, as eaſie and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, for that is the natural Senſe of calling them <hi>not ſo very formidable,</hi> &amp;c.

However, I ſhall wave that, and tell him, That he has extremely failed in the anſwer of this eaſie Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When he tells us, that the Nature of God is a <hi>Being.</hi> God is properly called a Being, but his Nature ought to be ſtiled an Eſſence and not a Being, when we ſpeak properly, and according to the formal Conception of things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To be a Being exiſting of it ſelf, is not of the Nature or Eſſence of God, otherwiſe the Son and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are not each of them God, for certainly neither the Son nor Holy Spirit exiſt of themſelves; to be a Being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting of it ſelf, is a perſonal property of the Father alone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Exiſting by it ſelf is but an explication of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Hypoſtaſis or <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> which indeed agrees to Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, but yet by the Conſent of ſober Divines, is not eſteemed an eſſential Predication, and conſequently ought not to be put into the Definition of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Incorporeal, Infinite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Attributes, that is, according to the Animadverter, Adjuncts to the Eſſence or Nature of God, how come they therefore to make up part of the Definition of the Nature of God? But I am tired, and have reaſon to believe my Reader ſo with

the obſervation of the Animadverter's Miſtakes, and therefore I have omitted very many I did obſerve, and doubtleſs a more attentive Reader would find many which eſcaped my notice.</p>
               <p>The Animadverter in this Book has concern'd himſelf chiefly with three Articles, Chriſt's Satisfaction, His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, and the Doctrine of the Trinity; and I do not find upon the ſtricteſt Search, that he underſtands any one of them.

               <p>A Perſon in this ſacred Myſtery is that to which the ternary Number belongs. Three Perſons, as a late Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author expreſſes it, <hi>are three Somewhats,</hi>

               <p>If we ſay with the Ancients three Hypoſtaſes, that is, three Subſtances, and neither St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> nor St. <hi>Hilary</hi> knew any other Senſe of the term Hypoſtaſes.

               <p>Secondly, To allot three Modes of Subſiſtence to one and the ſame ſingular God-head is quickly ſaid, but it is ſuch a Choke-pear, that the ſeveral Parties of the ſchola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Tribe have not known how to ſwallow.</p>

               <p>Secondly, If the Animadverter could get over the firſt Difficulty,<note place="margin">Anim. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 120.</note> he would find a ſecond behind, how one ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Being (which is the Animadverter's Hypotheſis of the Trinity) can have three Modes of Subſiſtence. The whole School of the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> and <hi>Scotiſts</hi> aſſert an abſolute eſſential Subſiſtence, and conſequently one Subſiſtence of the whole Trinity, they eſteem the three Divine Perſons to be <hi>unum ſubſiſtens; unum ſuppoſitum aut perſonam incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletam,</hi> ſays <hi>Cajetan,</hi> (one of the moſt famous Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators upon <hi>Aquinas</hi>) to which <hi>Suarez</hi> only replies,<note place="margin">Suarez de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car. q 3.

So that according to the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> and <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonalities are not three Modes of Subſiſtence, not three Subſiſtences, but one eſſential abſolute Subſiſtence with three Relations, or three relative Modes, or three Modes of Incommunicability.

                  </gap>, theſe Properties are not Names of the Eſſence, of the God-head, but of the Perſons. The God head does not properly ſubſiſt, but the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

               <p>The School-men retain in words the perſonal Acts of the Divine Perſons, that Generation is the perſonal Act of the Father, Incarnation, the perſonal Act of the Son, Sanctification, the perſonal Act of the Holy Spirit. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Spiration, the perſonal Act of the Father and Son. But theſe are meer words. Generation, according to the School-men, is the reflex Act of the Divine Underſtanding, whereby it knows it ſelf; and this ſingular individual Act they aſcribe in common to Father Son and Holy Ghoſt. So every thing that is an Act in Incarnation, is according to them, the Act of the whole Trinity: they pretend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the ſame ſingular reflex Act of the Divine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding only generates, as it proceeds from the Perſon of the Father: and that the Incarnation is only terminated upon the Perſon of the Son. But what Pretence to invent for Sanctification, I do not find that they are yet agreed. The ſacred Scriptures give Sanctification for the diſtinguiſhing Character of the third Perſon; he is ſo called in the very Form of Baptiſm: to deny this diſtinguiſhing Character was Sabellianiſm to the Ancients. Yet this the School-men have undeniably done in the Act of Sanctification. The Maxim of the Ancients was, that <hi>Opera Trinitatis ad extra ſunt indiviſa:</hi> They have not only miſconſtrued
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66343:82"/>
                  <hi>indiviſa</hi> for <hi>confuſa,</hi> but in reality, left out the Exception <hi>ad extra</hi> and confounded the Actions <hi>ad intra</hi> as well as thoſe <hi>ad extra.</hi> So Spiration to the School-men is that Act of the Divine Will, whereby it loves it ſelf, and this ſingular individual Act they alſo aſcribe to the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit equally with the Father and the Son. Only ſay they, The Divine Will's loving it ſelf is not Spiration in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Holy Ghoſt, but only in the Perſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son. How much better is it with the Ancient Fathers to confeſs theſe to be inſcrutable Myſteries, than to expoſe the ſacred Article by ſuch bold and abſtruſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, and yet theſe are the Gentlemen whom the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter commends for venturing little, for preceding upon the ſureſt grounds of Reaſon and Scripture.</p>
               <p>Again, Sanctification, which the divinely inſpired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings give us, as the peculiar <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Holy Ghoſt, relating to the Creatures, to a temporal Act, can never be the Perſonality of the Holy Ghoſt, but only a perſonal Property of the third Perſon of the Bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>The School-men take ſhelter in the Term <hi>Spirit,</hi> [which of it ſelf is common to the whole Trinity,] and call the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt by the Term, <hi>Spiration</hi> But the whole Greek Church believe the Holy Ghoſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Son, and yet denies the Eternal Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Son; and whatever may be ſaid for the pious Credibility of this Article in the Senſe of the Weſtern Church, yet I find, that our greateſt Divines, <hi>Laud, Stillingfleet, Chillingworth,</hi> &amp;c. have deny'd that this is an Article of Faith, or that the Greek Church is guilty of Hereſy in denying of it. Further, from St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> we learn that this Senſe of this Term, Spiration, was unknown to the Latin Church in his time.<note place="margin">Lib 5. de Tr. cap 11.</note>

               <p>Nor has the Miſſion of the Divine Perſons (which to the Ancients was a ſacred proof of the Plurality of Perſons in the Bleſſed Trinity) fared better in the Expoſition of the Schoolmen than the internal perſonal Acts.

               <p>This Argument, as he has framed it, is built upon a miſtake in Divinity. If we take this term <hi>God,</hi> in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete Senſe for <hi>habens Deitatem</hi> (in the ſingular number) there is no Diſtinction nor any Perſons in <hi>habente Deitatem.</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The Argument ought therefore to run thus: If Modes of Being ſhould not be allowed in the Trinity, then I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it to be impoſſible for any Diſtinction, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for any Perſons to be in the Trinity; and even
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66343:83"/>
thus framed, I take it to be the boldeſt Aſſertion I ever met with in Divinity. Another Perſon would certainly have worded the Argument thus, Then I conceive it to be impoſſible, or it ſeems to be impoſſible, but this pleaſes not our poſitive Animadverter; he <hi>affirms</hi> the thing to be impoſſible. I deny the conſequence <q rend="margQuotes">[which the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter proves thus: If there be any Diſtinction in God or the Deity, <hi>[or the Trinity]</hi> it muſt be either from ſome diſtinct Subſtance, or ſome Accident, or ſome Mode of Being. (For I deſire Him or any Mortal breathing to aſſign a fourth thing beſide theſe.) But it cannot be from any diſtinct Subſtance, for that would make a manifeſt Compoſition in the Divine Nature <hi>[or Trinity,]</hi> nor yet from any Accident, for that would make a worſe Compoſition; and therefore it follows, That this Diſtinction muſt unavoidably proceed from one or more diſtinct Modes of Being.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer briefly, That three diſtinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances make no Compoſition in the Trinity: Three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Subſtances make no Compoſition in a Trinity of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Every Plurality is not a Compoſition, but when the Plurality is by way of component Parts. But the Father, a Divine Perſon, is not a part of God, [that is, the Hereſy of <hi>Sabellius.</hi>] The Father, a Divine Perſon, is perfectly, compleatly God.</p>
               <p>An Accident would make a Compoſition in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible, that a Divine Perſon ſhould ſolely conſiſt of an Accident. A Divine Perſon is certainly a Subſtance, if therefore we add an Accident, we compound a Divine Perſon of Subſtance and Accident.</p>
               <p>By the ſame Argument, a Mode of Being inferrs a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. A Divine Perſon, the Father, can never be ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Mode, but muſt conſiſt of Subſtance and Mode,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> cap. 1. n. 14.</note> and become a modal <hi>compoſitum,</hi> as Subſtance and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent inferr an accidental <hi>compoſitum.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:66343:84"/>Secondly, A Mode is in its own Nature imperfect, as <hi>Suarez</hi> quoted before,<note place="margin">Chap. 1. n. 14.</note> ſays, <hi>Modus non poteſt non eſſe quid imperfectum, cum non attingat abſolutam rationem entis.</hi> But I will ask no other authority but his own to confute this ſingular Aſſertion of the Animadverter's, that there are Modes in God.

And this may ſuffice at preſent to anſwer his manifeſt Reaſon.</p>

               <p>The ſame miſtake has the Animadverter made in thoſe words of the Reverend Dean which he quotes <hi>p.</hi> 287. <hi>viz. That the ſame numerical Eſſence is whole and entire in each Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon but in a different manner.</hi>

               <p>The Divine Perſon of the Son, according to the Weſtern Church, is produced himſelf, and doth produce the Holy Spirit, which are oppoſite Relations, as well as Paternity and Filiation. But the contradiction vaniſhes ſince thoſe

oppoſite relations reſpect diſtinct Subjects. He is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Father, he doth produce the Holy Spirit. This therefore is the principal enquiry in this ſacred Article what is the Subject of Paternity, not what is Paternity? [that is but a ſecondary Article of leſs moment] what is the Subject of Filiation, not what Filiation is? What is the Subject of Proceſſion, not what Proceſſion is? in other words, what is the Father, what is the Son, what is the Holy Ghoſt? The Subject of Paternity is not the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Filiation, for then the Father would be the Son: Nor is the Subject of Proceſſion the Subject either of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity or Filiation, for then the Holy Ghoſt would either be Father or Son, or both.</p>
               <p>To ſay that the Divine Nature is the Subject of Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Filiation and Proceſſion is not only contrary to the Ancients who aſſert theſe Properties, not to be the Names of the Eſſence; but renders the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Hereſy impoſſible to be confuted, ſince an infinite Perſon is as capable of ſuſtaining theſe three diſtinct relations as an infinite nature; and makes one and the ſame Subject Father and Son to it ſelf; laſtly contradicts our formal conception of theſe ſacred Articles. The Divine Nature is according to our conception the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Form of the Divine Perſons, is predicated of the Divine Perſons <hi>in obliquo,</hi> Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt have each of them the full, whole, and entire Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in them.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66343:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Schoolmen, only they add, <hi>Relative</hi>] three infinite ſpiritual Beings, which is all the Reverend Dean under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>three infinite Spirits:</hi> That is, that they are not three Faculties or Affections of one Being, but three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Beings [Both Accidents and Modes are affections of Being.]</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is a very fruitfull Period of Paradoxes.

Whiteneſs the Affection; the Mode is an Abſtract, and by the Term abſtracts from the Subject.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Father is Eſſentially God by his Nature, this all confeſs; but who ever ſaid that the Father is Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially God by his Perſonality, by his Paternity?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There can be no ſuch Hereſy as that of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius,</hi> if every Mode of the Deity eſſentially includes the Deity: the Rankeſt <hi>Sabellianiſt</hi> never denied that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt, ſignified three Modes of the Deity.</p>

               <p>There are three kinds of <hi>Sabellianiſm:</hi> The firſt is the moſt common, the confounding the Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity, which was otherwiſe called the <hi>Patri-paſſian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, which aſſerts, That Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt are only three Names or three Offices of one Perſon, and conſequently that the Father ſuffered; this is properly the Hereſy of <hi>Noetus</hi> and not of <hi>Sabellius.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66343:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cauſe why they are leſs accurate in treating of this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than the Greek Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">II.</note>A ſecond <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Sabellianiſm,</hi> is the Contraction of the Trinity to the ſingle Perſon of the Father, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Father to be a true proper Perſon, aſſerting the Word or Son to be not ſtrictly and formally the Perſon of the Father, but an Attribute of the Father. His perſonal Wiſdom, in the ſame Analogy as Wiſdom is an habit of Man; in like manner aſſerting the Holy Spirit to be the perſonal Power of the Father. This <hi>Sabellius</hi> himſelf em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and explained the Trinity by the Similitude of the Body of the Sun, its Light or Ray and its Heat. The firſt,<note place="margin">Epiphan.

No Socinian in this Senſe will ſcruple a Father,<note place="margin">Vide Sti. Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lii Ep. 64.</note> a Word, and an Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>A third <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Sabellianiſm</hi> is the compounding the Divine Perſons, which is contrary to a Confuſion of them; this aſſerts a real diſtinction betwixt the Divine Perſons, but then it makes Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt to be (as) three parts of ſome whole.<note place="margin">Petav.

                  <note place="margin">Epiphan Haer. 62.</note> That the Trinity was by <hi>Sabellius</hi> ſometimes compared to the Body, Soul and Spirit in one Man.

Body alone, or the Soul alone, or the Spirit alone, but all three conjoyntly are one Man, ſo not the Father alone, or Son alone, or Holy Ghoſt alone, but all three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntly are God: whereas the Catholick Faith is, that each diſtinct Perſon is God. The Father is God the Father, the Son is God of God, the Holy Spirit is (in the Language of the Church) God the Holy Ghoſt. See both theſe kinds of Sabellianiſm condemned by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Oration <hi>contra gregales Sabellii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Phraſe of three Hypoſtaſes is contrary to all the Forms of the Sabellian Hereſy: Of the firſt there is no doubt; the ſecond is as plain; to be an Hypoſtaſis, and to be an Attribute are inconſiſtent and contradictory. So alſo to be an incompleat Part, a component Part and an Hypoſtaſis are inconſiſtent: It is eſſential to an Hypoſtaſis to have <hi>totale attributum,</hi> to be a compleat and perfect whole; ſo the Words of the firſt Article of the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion (quoted by the Animadverter, <hi>p.</hi> 278.) <q rend="margQuotes">Et utuntur nomine perſonae ea ſignificatione, qua uſi ſunt ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptores Eccleſiaſtici, ut ſignificet <hi>non partem aut qualita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſed quod propriè ſubſiſtet.</hi>
                  </q> That which properly ſubſiſts, can neither be as a Part of any Whole, nor as a Quality or Attribute of any Being.</p>

                  <hi>as three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Beings, not as three Powers or Faculties of the ſame Being, which is downright Sabellianiſm.</hi> The very Dreggs of Sabellianiſm, as I take it, worſe than Sabellianiſm; for as the Reverend Dean adds, <hi>Faculties are not Perſons,</hi> no nor one Perſon neither. A Million of Faculties and Attributes will not make one Perſon, A Million of Qualities will never make one Subſtance, and a Perſon is a Subſtance and a compleat Subſtance too. Again, a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Qualities, Attributes, Faculties, can never make one God; ſo that if Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, ſignify three

Faculties, three Attributes, three Modes, not only each ſingle Perſon is ungodded, but the whole Trinity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntly cannot be God.

               </p>
               <p>If the Animadverter means that a Relative Subſiſtence and a ſubſiſting Relation are, according to the Schoolmen, materially, identically the ſame thing, it is no News. The Schoolmen hold, that the Relation and the Divine Eſſence
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66343:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in each ſingle Perſon are thus identically the ſame: each ſingle Perſon being God, that is, a pure ſimple Act. But if he means, that they are formally the ſame, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that he underſtands neither of the Phraſes, nor what the Schoolmen meant by them.</p>
               <p>Subſiſtence (which himſelf very juſtly calls (<hi>p.</hi> 97.) <hi>Self-ſubſiſtence</hi>) is an abſolute Attribute, and can no more be relative, than Self-Conſciouſneſs. By a relative Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence the Schoolmen mean, that the Relation in each ſingle Perſon modifies the one, common, abſolute, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Subſiſtence, and renders it incommunicable, which of it ſelf, as being infinite, it was not. But a Divine Perſon being as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> obſerved, <hi>Hoc ipſum quod extat &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtit,</hi> and conſequently the Divine Perſons being three Somewhats ſubſiſting, three <hi>Hypoſtaſes in concreto,</hi> and not three Perſonalities with <hi>Peter Lombard; Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> and the other Schoolmen found out a relative Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a <hi>relationem per modum rei ſubſiſtentis,</hi> a Relation ſubſiſting, and affirm that the three Divine Perſons are three Relations ſubſiſting. But to this I anſwer: Firſt, That this will aſſert four Subſiſtences in the Trinity, one abſolute and eſſential, and three relative ones, by which the Relations ſubſiſt, which is contrary to all Antiquity. Secondly, This is but a ſubtler Diſguiſe for what the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Sentences ſpoke more plainly, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are not three Perſons in the ſame Senſe in which we ſay that the Father is a Perſon. For the Father is not Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and therefore not Paternity ſubſiſting: The Father is not a Relation ſubſiſting, but formally properly God, an infinite Mind. Laſtly, A Mode, a Relation ſubſiſting is perfectly unconceivable and contrary to the known rules of Philoſophy. And now it may be time to put an end to this Firſt Part, and to my Animadverſions upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverter, firſt taking a ſhort review how far I have proceeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:66343:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>My firſt Chapter is chiefly ſpent in explaining the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Terms uſed in this Myſtery, ſuch as Subſtance, Accident, Mode, the Nature of modal Difference, Eſſence, Exiſtence, Subſiſtence, modal Compoſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How much reaſon there was to re-examine the Animadverter's Definitions and Diſtinctions of theſe things in Relation to the Subject of the Trinity, I muſt leave to the Reader to judge, when he has peruſed the Chapter.</p>
               <p>My ſecond Chapter is chiefly ſpent in defending that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Illuſtration of the Incarnation, the Conjunction of the human Soul and Body in one Perſon, from the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Animadverter, one Queſtion of which was briefly touched, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 10. In the cloſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I give the Reader a very neceſſary and uſefull Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction concerning the formal reaſon of Perſonality, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference not only to Finite Perſons, but to the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>My third Chapter enquires how far a <hi>Prius</hi> and <hi>Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> may be admitted in the Trinity; whether Self-Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs be a perſonal Act? explains at large that Subtlety of the Schools concerning the relative Perſonality of the Divine Perſons, and ſhews the Animadverter's great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes therein; as alſo that Queſtion of the number of the Divine Perſons, why we believe a Trinity neither more nor fewer? As alſo that difficult Problem concerning the Singularity or Plurality of the Predication of any Attribute concerning the Divine Perſons, where I firſt give the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications themſelves, which are to be ſolv'd, and ſhew the Inſufficiency of the Schoolmen's Solutions from the Diſtinction of eſſential and perſonal Attributes, from the Diſtinction of Nouns Subſtantive and Nouns Adjective, from an abſolute and relative Predicate. Laſtly, I lay down the true rule my ſelf, which at perſent I only vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate from a Miſ-interpretation of the Schoolmen by diſtinguiſhing betwixt the Articles of the Unity of God
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66343:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Unity of the Trinity, which the Schoolmen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found.</p>
               <p>My fourth Chapter treats of the import of theſe Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Three infinite Minds, three Gods, three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, one infinite Mind, one God, and how far they are allowed or diſallowed in ſpeaking of the Trinity; of the Animadverter's Anſwer to the Objection of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm from the Phraſe of three Divine Perſons: and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally of the Notion of the Unity of God, and of the Appropriation of the title of Only True God to the Perſon of the Father, and of his being ſtiled the Fountain of the Divinity.</p>
               <p>My fifth Chapter is chiefly Hiſtorical of the Opinion of the Ancients, whether they believed the Divine Perſons to be three intelligent Beings? Of the import of that Phraſe, that the Son is the ſubſtantial WORD and Wiſdom of the Father, of the Particle <hi>OF</hi> in this Myſtery, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally I give an anſwer to the Socinian Objection from the Phraſe of three Divine Perſons, and enquire whether the ſame Wiſdom can be both begotten and unbegotten?</p>
               <p>My ſixth Chapter treats of what is Fundamental in this Myſtery, of the different Hypotheſes of explaining the Unity of the Trinity, of the Blaſphemy of the Modern So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians compared with their Predeceſſors; of the hiſtorical Truth of <hi>Petavius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>'s Aſſertion, that the ſpecifick Unity of the Trinity was embraced by the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Fathers, which I largely vindicate againſt the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter's Exceptions: the ſame diſcuſſed problemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally betwixt the Animadverter and my ſelf; Whether a Specifick Unity of the Trinity and a Numerical Unity were in the judgment of the Ancients inconſiſtent? Why <hi>Philopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and his Followers were called Tritheit Hereticks?</p>
               <p>My laſt Chapter treats of <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. Whether that place was the Warrant of the Phraſe of three Perſons or three Hypoſtaſes? Of the Divine Perſonalities, according to

Of the Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of three Modes to explain the Trinity, Whether the Divine Perſons differ modally or really? Of three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Species of Sabellianiſm; Of the Diſtinction of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Subſiſtence and a ſubſiſting Relation.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other material Enquiries in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of theſe, and others which are leſs material, which I leave to the Reader's own Obſervation.</p>
               <p>This, I hope, I may ſay of this preſent Eſſay, that there are very few of the material Diſputes of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men concerning this Article of the Trinity, which the Reader will not find either explained in this Eſſay, or at leaſt a ſufficient Key given to him, who ſhall deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Schoolmen themſelves.</p>
               <p>The many and great miſtakes of the Animadverter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me of the Uſefulneſs of ſuch an Explication; he often ſwallowed without chewing, what they ſtrained ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to believe, and at other times ſheltered himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Name and Authority, when his opinion was contradictorily oppoſite to theirs, and which is more, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got or omitted the principal and moſt material Enquiry in this Article of the Trinity, <hi>viz.</hi> What the three Divine Perſons are, that is, What <hi>Suppoſitum, Perſona, Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> ſignifies, when theſe terms are predicated plurally of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt.

               <p>I plainly ſaw that nine par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s in ten of the Objections of the Socinians are not levelled againſt the Fundamental Truth of this Article, the true Divinity of each ſingle Perſon and their real Diſtinction, but againſt the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Hypotheſis of the Schools, the Singularity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Divine Eſſence; theſe Objections are of no force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Nicene Hypotheſis, and therefore we meet not with them in the Writings of the Ancients, of the moſt learned Defenders of the Orthodox Faith againſt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sophiſtry of thoſe few Socinian Objections, which remain, appeared no leſs evident to me; and I doubted not by God's Grace to be able to make them appear ſo to any unprejudiced Reader, that is, I doubted not by God's Aſſiſtance ſatisfactorily to any unbyaſs'd Perſon to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Nicene Hypotheſis, and the Article of the Unity of God.</p>
               <p>I was fully perſwaded, that I could clearly anſwer all the Socinian Harangues of Nonſenſe and Contradiction, which they ſo confidently charge upon this Article of the Trinity, and thereby reduce the debate to this ſingle Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether the Article be revealed or not?</p>
               <p>The Article of the Trinity will ſtill be a Myſtery, that is, it will ſtill be unfathomable to us, Why there were a Trinity of Divine Perſons neither more nor fewer? How God an immaterial Spirit can generate or beget a Son? Why but one Son? Why the Holy Spirit is not alſo a Son? Wherein his Proceſſion differs from Filiation?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:66343:95"/>The Oeconomy alſo of the Divine Perſons will be a Myſtery; How Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt concurred to the Creation of the World? In what manner they joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted in the natural Kingdom of Providence? How they will govern after the ſurrender of the mediatorial King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Son of God?</p>
               <p>In theſe, and the like Queſtions did the Ancient Fathers place the Myſtery of this ſacred Article; in theſe the Nicene Hypotheſis, that I mean, which I propoſe as the Nicene Hypotheſis, ſtill places an unſearchable Myſtery.</p>
               <p>The Schoolmen can decide you theſe with the greateſt eaſe, if you believe them, with the greateſt exactneſs; but then inſtead of theſe which they pretend to ſolve, they have given us many others ten times more difficult.</p>
               <p>Theſe Myſteries claim expreſs Revelation for their Foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> That God has an only begotten Son and a Bleſſed Spirit proceeding from him; That God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made the Worlds, That the Son laid the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth, That the Spirit moved upon the Face of the Waters at the Creation. For theſe we have the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Ancient Fathers, theſe are manifeſtly Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties only in the <hi>Modus,</hi> we cannot indeed tell how they can be, nor can the Socinians prove that they cannot be. And I hope, theſe great Adorers of Reaſon, the Socinians, will eſteem God's Word a ſufficient proof for an Article of Faith, againſt which they have no ſolid Objection; at leaſt, I preſume, they will pardon the Orthodox, if they take not the Myſteriouſneſs of an Article, for an Objection againſt the truth of it; but this will be more proper, when I have finiſhed my Second Part which relates to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Unity of God, which if God grant Life and Health and Ability ſhall be performed with all convenient ſpeed. <hi>To God the Father Almighty, and his Eternal Son, and ever Bleſſed Spirit, be all Honour, Praiſe, Glory, Dominion and Power, now, henceforth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>
